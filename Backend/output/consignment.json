However, jasper, in addition to  or silica, contains an unusually large amount of impurities, mainly iron oxide. It is fine-grained and often strongly marked with orbicular or striped patterns. Red jasper is the most popular gemstone. Yellow, green, and brown colors also exist. These colors may be patchy in nature, several SiO2 of them maybe present in the same stone, and they may fade into each other. Iron combinations is the coloring agent for jasper gemstones.For instance iron oxide is responsible for the red color and oxidized ferric iron (ferrous iron) is responsible for green color.
