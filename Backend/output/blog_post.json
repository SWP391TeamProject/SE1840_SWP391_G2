Here’s his Q&amp;A:</em></p>\n<p>John is responsible for providing executive leadership, strategic vision, and high-level oversight of global operations and business development for the auction house. John has more than 15 years of experience in business development and growth strategy and holds a Master’s Degree in engineering. <span id=\"more-1683\"></span>Prior to Fortuna, he served as an executive at a global engineering and project management firm, where his primary responsibilities involved oversight of global operations and business development for the energy division. John also co-founded and owned small businesses in the software, real estate, and education industries.</p>\n<h3>Where did the idea for Fortuna come from?</h3>\n<p>Fortuna was originally started as a fine jewelry auction house with a core mission of protecting the seller. Two of the co-founders had been in the jewelry industry for many years and had bad experiences with other auction houses that led them to realize that there was a serious opportunity to build an auction house that protected sellers from all of the risks that have, over centuries of business, become so commonplace in the industry.</p>\n<p>For many reasons, when one would like to sell their fine jewelry (and other precious belongings), the best place to do it is at auction. The auction, by its nature, when executed properly, is designed to bring the seller the highest fair market value for the goods they are selling. There are two primary reasons why one might avoid auction, however. One is “time”. Auctions, by their nature, take time. Some auction houses hold onto jewelry (and other goods for sale) for as long as six months, or more. The second reason why one might decide not to sell through auction, is “cost”. Most auction houses charge hefty fees for their services, on top of the sellers premium. These include fees for marketing, cataloging, photography, insurance, and often an “unsold lot fee”. Furthermore, these fees are usually assessed regardless of whether or not the jewelry sells.</p>\n<p>At Fortuna, we do our best to eliminate both concerns. For one, if a consignor/seller is in need of money immediately, we have methods by which we can provide immediate funds before the auction even takes place. This eliminates the “time” concern. Secondly, and most importantly, we believe strongly that, if we cannot successfully sell your jewelry (and other precious belongings), then you owe us nothing. We are proud to be the world’s only no-risk fine jewelry auction. We charge no fees for our services. All photography, cataloging, marketing, and insurance are provided by our world-class team or professionals, free of charge. We only make money if your jewelry sells – and we are happy to say that even our sellers premium is lower than most of our competitors’.</p>\n<h3>What does your typical day look like and how do you make it productive?</h3>\n<p>I spend most of my day on business development – talking to and meeting with clients. In between meetings, I work on various higher level strategic tasks that the business needs (i.e., developing new programs and processes). However, before any of this occurs, I start each and every day with a structured morning routine that includes meditation, visualization, and physical exercise. Starting my day this way allows me to approach the day with a clear and focused mind and I contribute a lot of my productivity throughout the day to the way that I start it. Following my early morning routine, I head in to the office. Before diving into any work or attending any meetings, I always spend the first few minutes creating a list of priorities for the day and I use that list to keep me organized throughout the day – this greatly impacts my productivity.</p>\n<h3>How do you bring ideas to life?</h3>\n<p>When I have an idea that I believe in, I spend time mentally approaching the idea from all angles and then I develop an execution plan. I then disseminate the idea and plan to the appropriate people within the organization and work with them to develop a budget and schedule for the project. Then we get to work. The key, I have found, is developing a well-thought-out idea and a strong execution plan to implement the idea. Following this, it is important to deliver the vision and plan in an articulate and inspirational manner to the team that will be executing. The idea finally comes to life when our hard-working team of high-performing people fully deliver.</p>\n<h3>What’s one trend that excites you?</h3>\n<p>There is a trend in world right now towards inter-connectivity. There are billions of people in the world, each with their own set of ideas, skills, tools, beliefs, likes, dislikes, daily activities, experiences, etc. By finding synergistic overlaps between people and connecting them, a massive amount of progress can be made. There are already many companies doing this in their own ways, however, there is still a lot of room for new ideas and improvements to existing business models. This trend is truly exciting, as I believe it will continue to uncover massive amounts of before-unrealized potential. This trend is and I believe will continue to change the world.</p>\n<h3>What is one habit of yours that makes you more productive as an entrepreneur?</h3>\n<p>As simple as it sounds, one of the habits that makes me most productive is my habit to write everything down. I use a legal pad and any thought, idea, notes on a discussion, list of things that need to be done, etc. all get written down the minute they enter my head. This one simple thing has helped my productivity levels tremendously over the years.</p>\n<h3>What advice would you give your younger self?</h3>\n<p>I would tell my younger self to set higher goals, fully embrace healthy obsessions, live to improve and be the best you can be at everything that you do, and always believe in yourself, your dreams, and your ability to truly achieve anything you set your mind to.</p>\n<h3>Tell us something that’s true that almost nobody agrees with you on?</h3>\n<p>Obsession is the single most important thing to achieving extreme success.</p>\n<h3>As an entrepreneur, what is the one thing you do over and over and recommend everyone else do?</h3>\n<p>The one thing that I think I do over and over again, that I believe everyone should do, is to keep a constant line of communication open with myself – a feedback loop – where I continually work on self improvement by analyzing my own ideas and actions and asking myself if I am truly approaching things in the best possible manner.</p>\n<h3>What is one strategy that has helped you grow your business? Please explain how.</h3>\n<p>Obsession and total domination. I am not in business to come in second place at anything. I firmly believe that I, with the support of my partners, can be the best at anything we set our minds to. Approaching each and every situation and challenge with this mindset has helped us see tremendous success in all that we do.</p>\n<h3>What is one failure you had as an entrepreneur, and how did you overcome it?</h3>\n<p>Honestly, I don’t believe in failure. I have never failed and will not fail. I have stumbled and even fallen, but never quit the race – I have and will always keep going. Failure only occurs, I believe, when you give up. When something doesn’t go the way I planned it, I adjust and keep moving forward. The goals, plan, and path may change but the race doesn’t. The ultimate goal is success and success is always achievable if you never quit.</p>\n<h3>What is one business idea that you’re willing to give away to our readers?</h3>\n<p>There are so many opportunities in today’s world and I have many ideas, most of which I plan on pursuing, however, there are a few ideas that I will likely never pursue and I believe that the world would be a better place if we shared such ideas with each other in the hopes that someone finds a way to turn a raw idea into a successful business that in some way benefits the world. One idea that I have is “A tool borrowing platform”. I’ve seen it attempted before but not successfully, as far as I can tell. Here’s the general idea: I live in NYC. When I need a tool, such as a hammer, I might ask my neighbor if he/she has one but if they don’t, I go and buy one. If I was able to open an app that was able to connect me with another person nearby that had a hammer and was wiling to loan it to me for $2/day, it would solve my problem and help the owner of the hammer make earn some passive income.</p>\n<h3>What is the best $100 you recently spent? What and why?</h3>\n<p>I would say that the best $100 I recently spent was for some of the books that I have recently purchased. I am a strong believer in education for life. One should never stop learning and growing as a person and professional in their field. This grown and development starts with knowledge and one of the best places to gain knowledge is by reading the thoughts and ideas of others. Furthermore, I firmly believe that books are one of the best investments (in terms of actual ROI) that one can find. For just $20, you can improve yourself and change your way of thinking and in fact your life. Some of the most recent books I have bought include: ‘<a href=\"http://geni.us/r3Wq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Be Obsessed or Be Average</em></a>,’ by Grant Cardone; ‘<a href=\"http://geni.us/VmYY5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Millionaire Fastlane</em></a>,’ by M. J. DeMarco; ‘<a href=\"http://geni.us/Df2N3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The 10X Rule</em></a>,’ by Grant Cardone; ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People,’ by Dale Carnegie; and ‘Awaken The Giant Within,’ by Tony Robbins.</p>\n<h3>What is one piece of software or a web service that helps you be productive? How do you use it?</h3>\n<p>Salesforce. At Fortuna we use Salesforce as our CRM platform and it is incredibly useful for keeping our sales and customer service processes streamlined and organized. We use this software to track every aspect about our relationships with our clients. We keep records on all contact information and custom notes as well as any communications that occur via phone, text, or email with that client. In addition, we track all sales opportunities and are able to visibly push each opportunity through our sales funnel. In addition, Salesforce offers a whole host of other reporting and other powerful tools to help manage client relationships.</p>\n<h3>What is the one book that you recommend our community should read and why?</h3>\n<p>There are so many, but if I had to pick just one that would inspire this audience of entrepreneurs, it would have to be<a href=\"http://geni.us/VmYY5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em> Millionaire Fastlane</em></a>, by M. J. DeMarco.</p>\n<h3>Key Learnings</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When I have an idea that I believe in, I spend time mentally approaching the idea from all angles and then I develop an execution plan.</li>\n<li>The one thing that I think I do over and over again, that I believe everyone should do, is to keep a constant line of communication open with myself – a feedback loop – where I continually work on self improvement by analyzing my own ideas and actions and asking myself if I am truly approaching things in the best possible manner.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What is your favorite quote?</h3>\n<p>The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.</p>\n<p>– Steve Jobs</p>\n\t\t","date":"2017-06-07T15:49:55.000Z"},{"id":6,"authorId":5,"categoryId":2,"title":"Magnificent Jewels a Record-Breaking Auction for Fortuna","content":"<div style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/VividStuds.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"325\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Pair of Fancy Vivid Yellow Diamond Studs, 4.04ct Total.

The 10.33ct diamond ring was consigned by an affluent collector on the West Coast, and created a buzz of excitement among diamond collectors and connoisseurs. Not only was the diamond graded as the top color and clarity, but was also determined to be Type IIa. Often called “Golconda” diamonds, after the famous mine in India, Type IIa diamonds are the most chemically pure and are highly sought after by collectors. The chemical purity makes a D grade stone look even whiter than other D grade stones, and often gives them a transparent, watery appearance—making them a true treasure to collectors.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CartierFlower.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"325\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cartier Coral Diamond and Emerald Brooch.

It was here that she began her formal study of jewelry design. Knowing that versatility would give her the competitive advantage she sought, Belperron immersed herself and excelled in a variety of studies.

Her talent was recognized quickly, and within four years she was the lead designer. While she created countless designs in the popular Art Deco style, she quickly grew tired of the rigid aesthetic and began experimenting in a more organic&nbsp;style, assimilating natural forms and motifs. In 1932 she left Boivin to join Bernard Herz, a prominent dealer in gemstones and pearl. Herz recognized her virtuosity and skill, and Belperron was given full artistic freedom to design in his name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote><p>“There’s no one else like her.” – Karl Lagerfeld, Avid Belperron Collector</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This partnership put forth a daring new look for jewelry that was stunningly modern. Finding inspiration in a wide range of cultures—African, Cambodian, Celtic, Egyptian and Indian—her designs incorporated an unconventional use of materials and techniques including carved gemstones displaying bold and sensual silhouettes, now an unmistakable mark of her production.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>\n<div class=\"cols-wrapper cols-2\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-T02Z8/suzanne-belperron-cambodian-chalcedony-cuff\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BoCuff1Seth_resized.jpg\" alt=\"Suzanne Belperron Cambodian Chalcedony Cuff\" width=\"4568\" height=\"5912\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Belperron “Cambodian” Chalcedony Cuff</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col nomargin\">\n<p><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-T02Z6/suzanne-belperron-sapphire-chalcedony-ring\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Belperron-Sapphire-Chalcedony-Ring_Square-1.jpg\" alt=\"Suzanne Belperron Sapphire and Chalcedony Ring\" width=\"3658\" height=\"3659\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Belperron Sapphire Chalcedony Ring</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"p1\">Close friend and fellow jewelry designer, Christopher Walling, holds fond memories of the time he spent with Belperron. As a woman of extreme aesthetic sensitivity, everything from her home décor to her hair color was impeccably thought out. Her house was filled with an elegant mélange, from contemporary French furniture to pre-Columbian art and Tang Dynasty horses. When commenting on her personal style, Walling recalls that the same care was taken, “It was always white with pearls, or white with diamonds. Green with emeralds; blue with sapphires. And it may not sound like it would work, but it did. And it was extraordinary […] It wasn’t frivolous; it was a continuation of her art.”</p>\n<div class=\"cols-wrapper cols-3\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<p><img class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/63-1.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col\">\n<p><img class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/63-2.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col nomargin\">\n<p><img class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/63-3.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">While Belperron’s designs caught the eye of countless European nobility and jewelry connoisseurs alike, their relative scarcity due to their unique nature and limited production has led many of her works to remain hidden from the public. It is estimated that Belperron only made between 3,000 and 5,000 jewels in her lifetime.

This particular model is certainly considered to be the most authentic. It was the reference number that actor and racecar driver, Paul Newman originally wore, and the one that ignited the worldwide obsession for the Rolex Daytona with the “Exotic dial.” For those enamored by Rolex’s complex journey of manufacturing and outsourcing before they became the vertically-integrated company that we know today, the Paul Newman Daytona represents a very interesting segment of Rolex history. During the 1960s, a small portion of the watch dials for Rolex’s newest watch at the time, the Daytona, was made by the company Singer. This “Exotic Dial” completely transformed the look of the watch, most notably with the use of the Art Deco fonts and indexes with squared tops in the sub-dials and the introduction of a third color—the contrasting red minute track and “Daytona” moniker.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read full article on <a href=\"https://www.ablogtowatch.com/fortuna-auctions-important-watches-sale/\">A Blog to Watch</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>Fortuna Auction IMPORTANT WATCHES: Event Details</strong></h4>\n<div class=\"cols-wrapper cols-2\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>IMPORTANT WATCHES Sale</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">12:00 PM June 28, 2018</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">At the Fortuna Showroom in NYC</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">(608 5th Avenue &amp; 49th Street.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col nomargin\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<strong>Auction Previews</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">June 18-22, 24-27 at the Fortuna Showroom</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Weekdays: 10AM-5PM</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Weekends: 12PM-5PM</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>View the auction catalog for June IMPORTANT WATCHES&nbsp;<a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-10K6E7/important-watches-sale-1021\">here</a>.</p>\n\t\t","date":"2018-06-09T19:44:05.000Z"},{"id":15,"authorId":3,"categoryId":3,"title":"Robert and Louis Koch","content":"<h3><span class=\"drop-caps\">R</span>ecognized by their supremely sophisticated style, Robert and Louis Koch are two of the most celebrated German jewelers of their time.

The Koch brothers’ production of regal tiaras, crowns, diadems and bandeaux, which supplied the German imperial family as well as aristocrats and millionaires alike, solidified their presence in the local market, while their acute business sense led to their successful expansion to further international clientele. The strategic placement of a store in the fashionable spa resort of Baden Baden and Louis’s impeccable taste and salesmanship drew the attention of even more European royalty; and soon, the King of Italy, the Russian Tsar and the Prince of Wales were all looking to adorn their courts with the brothers’ creations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 1902, Robert Koch passed away, leaving Louis to take charge of the company. Louis managed to successfully lead the firm for nearly half a century, through the difficult post-World War I years and widespread economic recession. Even after his subsequent death, the firm continued to be prosperous in the hands of his grandsons and nephews. During the oppressive Nazi regime, the company was “Aryanized,” and taken over by Robert Bosch and the family eventually lost control of the firm. Although the popularity of the company was briefly revived in the 1950s, Koch jewelry from the late 19th and early 20th century continue to be considered the golden period of the Koch House, are very much sought after in today’s antique jewelry market.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-3092\"></span></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-10K74N/fine-jewels-sale-1022\">This June</a>, Fortuna Offers an Impressive Example of Koch Brothers’ Eye for Design—An Egyptian Revival Emerald, Tourmaline and Diamond Necklace.</h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"cols-wrapper cols-2\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<div style=\"width: 4017px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-13O0XN/koch-brothers-emerald-tourmaline-and-diamond-necklace\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Koch-Necklace-Close-up.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4007\" height=\"4007\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A close-up of Koch Brothers Emerald, Tourmaline and Diamond Necklace, offered this June in Fortuna’s FINE JEWELS sale, Lot 222.</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col nomargin\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 3010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-13O0XN/koch-brothers-emerald-tourmaline-and-diamond-necklace\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/222-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3000\" height=\"3000\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The craze for Egyptian art and artifacts that swept through Europe during the mid to late 19th century naturally found its way into the fashion and jewelry world, inspiring the frequent use of Egyptian motifs, such as the winged scarab as seen above, a symbol of rebirth and regeneration.</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A highly collectable piece which fully embodies the quality that led Robert and Louis Koch to be popularly known as the “Cartier of Germany,” this graceful Egyptian revival necklace remains a proud highlight of the June <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-10K74N/fine-jewels-sale-1022\">FINE JEWELS</a> collection offered by Fortuna.

He schooled his fellow craftsmen in the production of his pieces, using ancient techniques such as granulation, filigree, hand-weaving, and hand-hammering to create pieces that are steeped in antiquity. His inexhaustible creativity and appreciation of antique crafts led him to be the first goldsmith to be honored by the Académie des Beaux-Arts et des Lettres, for his contribution to the art of jewelry.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>History of Ilias Lalaounis</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in 1920 as a fourth-generation Athenian goldsmith, the art of fine jewelry crafting was always Ilias Lalaounis’s destiny. After taking the helm at his family’s jewelry firm, Lalaouinis began to pave the path for his future passion — blending a love for Grecian art and jewelry-making practices with the twist of modern technology. Before long, Lalaounis was making a name for himself as he crafted unique pieces that reimagined ancient Greek artifacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Introducing His Collection to the World</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lalaouinis’ first collection — which was heavily inspired by classical and Hellenistic art — debuted in 1957. This launch was met with international acclaim, providing the perfect starting point for a new company, which he would start more than a decade later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lalalounis’ company presented an avenue to delve even deeper into his distinct style, which was characterized by a focus on gold materials. He&nbsp;primarily drew inspiration from the historical periods spanning from prehistoric Minoan art through the art of the English Tudors, as well as humanistic elements of nature and animals.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Expanding His Legacy Overseas</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lalaounis’s company soon found success overseas, expanding to galleries across Europe, the U.S. and Asia. Between 1969 and 2002, Lalaounis presented 50 collections worldwide. In 1993, he unveiled the Ilias Lalalounis Jewelry Museum, located at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens. This museum — run today by his daughters — continues to be a cultural center connecting ancient history with the present day through jewelry.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/121745258-6ad7bbad19870f10c30c3f5d9b0f8e135d3294e058bf5cbb6ce33a67ec1af210-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8277\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/121745258-6ad7bbad19870f10c30c3f5d9b0f8e135d3294e058bf5cbb6ce33a67ec1af210-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/121745258-6ad7bbad19870f10c30c3f5d9b0f8e135d3294e058bf5cbb6ce33a67ec1af210-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/121745258-6ad7bbad19870f10c30c3f5d9b0f8e135d3294e058bf5cbb6ce33a67ec1af210-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/121745258-6ad7bbad19870f10c30c3f5d9b0f8e135d3294e058bf5cbb6ce33a67ec1af210-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/121745258-6ad7bbad19870f10c30c3f5d9b0f8e135d3294e058bf5cbb6ce33a67ec1af210-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/121745258-6ad7bbad19870f10c30c3f5d9b0f8e135d3294e058bf5cbb6ce33a67ec1af210-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/121745273-a4070e303b5816042dcefb95d7b519f4567837e1a7653a9818194ab26bc2b647-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8276\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/121745273-a4070e303b5816042dcefb95d7b519f4567837e1a7653a9818194ab26bc2b647-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/121745273-a4070e303b5816042dcefb95d7b519f4567837e1a7653a9818194ab26bc2b647-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/121745273-a4070e303b5816042dcefb95d7b519f4567837e1a7653a9818194ab26bc2b647-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/121745273-a4070e303b5816042dcefb95d7b519f4567837e1a7653a9818194ab26bc2b647-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/121745273-a4070e303b5816042dcefb95d7b519f4567837e1a7653a9818194ab26bc2b647-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/121745273-a4070e303b5816042dcefb95d7b519f4567837e1a7653a9818194ab26bc2b647-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption><em>Ilias Lalaounis Hinged Choker (Lot 2110) and matching bracelet (Lot 2111), offered in the November 2020 Jewels &amp; Watches auction.</em></figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Discover Ilias Lalaounis’s Most Beloved Pieces</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ilias Lalaounis is said to describe his own pieces as “jewelry with soul.”&nbsp;This inspiration paved the way for a collection of lifelike pieces that draw incredible warmth and vivacity from each gemstone’s striking beauty.&nbsp;His iconic style is characterized by an orchestration of ancient styles with bold reimagined statement pieces.

There are four or five well-known watch auction houses (you know who they are) that have pretty much dominated that side of the industry for as long as most people can remember. Of course, there are other, more regional auction houses but, on an international, even national level, it’s quite rare to see a new face pop up.</p>\n<p>However, with&nbsp;<strong>Fortuna</strong>, a seven-year-old auction house that has made its name on the jewelry side of the collecting world, that’s not the case… the young business is poised to make a name for itself thanks to a straightforward pricing strategy and a hands-on and no-risk approach to buying and selling.</p>\n<p>“The origin of the auction house was to protect and look out for the seller, because in our experience, the buyers, they’re the knowledgeable ones,” says John Saxon. “It’s the person that inherits their grandfather’s watch, or it’s the woman that is going through a bad divorce and needs to sell her jewelry. Those are the people that are at a lot of risk. So we really wanted to build a business that would hold their hand and protect them and guide them through the process, and that became the foundation for it.”</p>\n<p>Fortuna does this through a customer-first approach that offers a true white glove experience for clients whether they are buying or selling. Say you place a bid and win a $15,000 watch in tomorrow’s inaugural auction. The team at Fortuna will handle each step of the process for you from payment to shipping.</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.watchtime.com/?s=fortuna+auction\"><em>Read full article on WatchTime.com</em></a></p>\n\t\t","date":"2018-06-27T14:34:35.000Z"},{"id":18,"authorId":7,"categoryId":2,"title":"FORTUNA Concludes June Auction Series in a Strong Fashion","content":"<h3>As an auction house with a predominant fine jewelry focus, Fortuna establishes itself in the niche world of Haute horology with the high-profile sale of a Rolex “Paul Newman” Daytona.</h3>\n<p>Following the success of Fortuna’s April auctions and the monumental sale of <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/estate-of-bo-legendre-highlights/\">The Estate of Bo Legendre</a>, Fortuna has continued to achieve strong results into the summer, despite it being a traditionally slow season for the rest of the industry. Total revenue of Fortuna’s summer auctions amounted to over $2.1 million, with over 80% of the lots sold—an impressive feat in the auction industry. Soaring hammer prices for a medley of rare estate jewelry and vintage timepieces met an animated and crowded showroom of fine jewelry and watch connoisseurs. Approximately 79.4% of the lots offered in the summer auctions exceeded pre-sale estimates, reflecting strong bidder activity from private collectors in 47 countries.</p>\n<h4><strong>IMPORTANT WATCHES Post-Sale Highlights</strong></h4>\n<p>June 28th IMPORTANT WATCHES was Fortuna’s first watch-only sale and a demonstration of the newfound confidence Fortuna has inspired in the watch collector community, likely resulting from the strong prices the auction house was able to achieve in April’s <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/april-important-jewels-watches-post-sale-highlights/\">Important Jewels &amp; Watches</a> sale.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 641px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-13OOZ2/a-rare-and-highly-desirable-rolex-paul-newman-daytona-ref-6239\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2104-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rolex Paul Newman Daytona - Fortuna Important Watches\" width=\"631\" height=\"631\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Rare and Highly Desirable Rolex “Paul Newman” Daytona, Ref. 6239 (Lot 2104) sold for $212,500—soaring past its starting bid of $120,000.</p></div>\n<p>The highlight of the sale was indubitably the <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-13OOZ2/a-rare-and-highly-desirable-rolex-paul-newman-daytona-ref-6239\">Rolex “Paul Newman” Daytona Ref. 6239 (Lot 2104)</a>, the world-famous vintage watch that has generated an unwavering cult following.

As a young man, Tony Duquette was awarded scholarships to the renowned Chouinard Institute in Los Angeles and the Yale School of Theater. Growing to become one of the most recognized LA designers of the time, it was through the patronage of Sir Charles and Lady Mendl, the then international arbiters of taste, that Duquette was able to establish himself as a designer for the film industry. He created both costumes and sets for theater, opera and ballet, as well as many Metro Goldwyn Mayer films.<span id=\"more-3419\"></span></p>\n<div style=\"width: 338px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tony-Duquette-Jewelry-Fortuna-Fine-Jewelry-Watch-Auction-House.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Duquette \" width=\"328\" height=\"471\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tony Duquette (1914-1999) earned world-wide fame for his stunning, extravagant designs for stage and film.</p></div>\n<p>In 1949 he married the talented artist Elizabeth Johnstone. Their wedding reception included celebrity guests such as Greta Garbo and Fred Astaire, amongst others. In 1951, Duquette was honored by the Louvre Museum in Paris to represent the decorative arts of the middle of the 20th century with a one-man exhibition, becoming the first American to ever receive such recognition. His costumes for the original Broadway production of Camelot garnered him the prestigious Tony Award for Best Costume. The Tony Duquette Studios were also responsible for a myriad of custom interiors for both residential and commercial installations throughout America and Europe. His clients included Elizabeth Arden, the Duchess of Windsor, and Sharon Stone. Tony worked in his 80’s, creating unique fine jewelry for Balmain and Tom Ford at Gucci.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>While Duquette passed away in 1999, the Tony Duquette Studios continues creating custom interiors, fine jewelry and decorative home products for a discerning clientele worldwide under the direction of Hutton Wilkinson who has been Tony Duquette’s business partner since 1972.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 262px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Duchess-of-Windsor-in-Tony-Duquette-Fortuna-Auction-Fine-Jewelry-Watch-Auction.jpg\" alt=\"Duchess of Windsor Tony Duquette\" width=\"252\" height=\"420\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shown: The Duchess of Windsor, adorned by a floral wreath necklace that Tony Duquette designed for her—a piece that she would wear throughout her life.</p></div>\n<p>Fortuna is excited to offer eight pieces that testify to Duquette’s singular style and artistic sensitivity, which has crystalized his work as an American cult favorite. An extremely versatile designer, one can see through this collection how Duquette moves seamlessly between minimalism and his love for the over-the-top. Indeed, the same artist that created the sleek chalcedony and gold necklace with crisp lines and understated use of color, also created the almost larger-than-life, neo-baroque <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-19Z40Q/tony-duquette-coral-fire-opal-cultured-pearl-and-diamond-memento-mori-brooch\">“Memento Mori”</a> brooch complete with a coral scull and petrified wood.</p>\n<p>Duquette’s work stands out not only because of its bold style, but also because of his choice of materials. Loving beauty over luxury, Duquette selected gemstones according to the effect they provided, not their precious value. Of Duquette’s aesthetic approach to jewelry, his partner Hutton Wilkinson stated “Mixing the high and low lends a sense of irony to Tony Duquette pieces, takes the curse off them, prevents them from becoming ‘too important,’ and focuses attention on their uniqueness rather than their monetary value. The Tony Duquette collector not only appreciates these pieces as works of art but also for the sheer pleasure they bring, regardless of whether they are comprised of pebbles and shells found washed up on the beach or diamonds and rubies.”</p>\n<div class=\"section-full-width section-dark parallax-fixed\" style=\"background-color:#2f2f2f;\"><div style=\"background-image:url(https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Tony-Duquette-Momento-Mori-Brooch.jpg); opacity:0.6; filter: alpha(opacity=60);\" class=\"full-bg-image\"></div><div class=\"section-boxed\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\"><h2 class=\"section-title\" style=\"color:#ffffff;\">Talismans of Power</h2><h4 style=\"color:#ffffff;\" class=\"sub-title\">Tony Duquette's extravagant celebration of the diversity of world cultures &amp; beliefs.</h4></div></div>\n<p>Duquette celebrated his 80th birthday with the opening of his one-man-show at the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Culture Center in Westwood, California.

Adjunct to the all-immersive set up, Duquette exhibited two hundred pieces of jewelry from a collection which he called the “Talismans of Power.”</p>\n<p>Rooting this collection is the rich history of talismans. Through different cultures and time periods, talisman were held as objects of protection, healing and even magic. Duquette produced what is today the richest work of his jewelry oeuvre – reaching a climax in scale and general eccentricity, the artist produced massive necklaces all filled with a shamanistic aesthetic as exemplified in the <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-19Z40Y/an-impressive-tony-duquette-talismans-of-power-large-carved-jade-necklace\">tiger’s eye, jade and agate necklace</a> shown in the image gallery below.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a class=\"button\" href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/selling/\n\">Sell at Auction&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;

First introduced with the “Daytona” signature in 1965, the watch proclaimed Rolex’s sponsorship of the celebrated sports car race in Daytona Beach, Florida. For the Daytona specifically, Rolex had introduced a couple of major stylistic changes from its earlier chronographs, drastically improving the utility of the watch with a race car driver’s needs in mind. First, the inverse colors of the main dial and registers provided the watch with a sportier look and clear contrast to read elapsed times in each sub-dial. Second, the tachymeter scale was removed from the dial and engraved onto the bezel, allowing for greater legibility.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 942px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Daytona-Beach.jpg\" alt=\"Daytona Beach\" width=\"932\" height=\"524\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The historic Daytona race was born at the turn of the 20th century, at Daytona Beach (shown above). Only in 1959, did the race relocate to the world-famous Daytona International Speedway.</p></div>\n<p>Yet despite its durability, aesthetics, and reliable movement, the Daytona was not hugely in demand when produced. In fact, many sat at retailers before they were sold, and often at steep discounts. At the time, Rolex was competing with a host of other watch brands that had already been well-known for creating chronographs. Furthermore, the Daytona remained a manually-wound timepiece until 1987, during the height of the world-wide craze for quartz movements.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-3444\"></span></p>\n<p>Like all success stories, the tides would turn for the Daytona. The cult surrounding its “exotic dials,” popularized by Paul Newman, coupled with the strong return of wristwatch collecting in the late 1980s would elevate the Daytona to become one of the most famous and coveted watches of all time.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 1010px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Rolex-Daytona-Brochure.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"733\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A 1970 advertising spread for the Rolex Cosmograph Daytona Ref. 6239.</p></div>\n<p>And in typical Rolex fashion, the Swiss brand would continue to innovate and improve on the Daytona, all while maintaining their strict codes of time-keeping accuracy. Rolex’s first iteration of self-winding Daytona’s incorporated the Zenith “El Primero” movement. It was the only automatic chronograph movement that Rolex deemed acceptable by their standards, and even so it was still heavily modified. In 2000, Rolex presented the culmination of years of development, the Daytona Ref. 116520—featuring the in-house caliber 4130. Rolex introduced significant changes—such as a chronograph function that could run continuously without negative effects, improved shock resistance of the balance wheel, and more—all while eliminating redundancy in parts, making it a much more serviceable watch. To many collectors, the combination of the enhanced water resistance of the Oyster Perpetual case and the near-flawless caliber 4130 makes the Ref. 116520 <em>the</em> ultimate Daytona.</p>\n<p>With over 50 years of history, starting off as highly utilitarian piece of equipment, the Rolex Daytona remains to this day the perfect watch for any occasion. In all its omission of decorative features typical of other high-end watches, the watch is nigh-indestructible and meant to be worn every single day of a man’s life.

The auctions offered an exemplary collection of jewelry and watches from the most prestigious makers in their craft, including Cartier, Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Tiffany &amp; Co., Rolex, and Omega.</p>\n<p>Highlighting Fortuna’s first sale of the season, Session One: <em>Magnificent Jewels</em>, was an exquisite 3.05ct Fancy Intense Blue diamond ring. Naturally occurring blue diamonds are found in less than 0.02% of all diamonds mined and are one of the rarest gemstones in the world. This particular blue diamond ring was consigned by an important Asian collector and exhibited a gorgeous and vibrant blue hue that is rarely seen, even among blue diamonds. After a round of tense bidding that had the auction floor buzzing with excitement, the ring achieved $1,395,000, selling to a phone bidder.</p>\n<div class=\"cols-wrapper cols-3\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Blue-Diamond-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col\">\n<p><img class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Blue-Diamond-2.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col nomargin\">\n<p><img class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Blue-Diamond-1.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>In addition to colored diamonds, <em>Magnificent Jewels</em> also featured an exquisite assortment of rare estate jewels and signed pieces spanning many historical style periods. Of the many jewelry highlights, a stunning Art Deco Cartier sapphire and diamond bracelet truly evoked the classic glamour that is characteristic of the Roaring Twenties era. The piece achieved $76,800 USD against a pre-sale estimate of $60,000-$90,000.<span id=\"more-4051\"></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Art-Deco-Cartier-Sapphire-and-Diamond-Bracelet.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"720\"></p>\n<p>Another rare piece of the sale was a René Boivin ring, featuring a large Old-European cut diamond. The French design house of René Boivin was known to create some of the most original and modern sculptural pieces of the time, setting themselves apart from the typical aesthetic that characterized jewelry of the 1930s and 1940s. The collectability of René Boivin jewelry continues to grow over time, as demonstrated by this particular piece which achieved $137,500 USD.</p>\n<p>Fortuna has been particularly successful with period pieces originating from various style eras such as Victorian, Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Edwardian, and Retro. Of all period pieces offered, December <em>Magnificent Jewels</em> achieved an 83% sell-through rate by value, with numerous lots hammering for prices far past their starting bids, illustrating that antique jewelry continues to be a highly covetable asset in the market.</p>\n<p>John Saxon, Fortuna’s CEO &amp; President, firmly believes these results are setting the stage for outstanding performance in 2019. “We are witnessing a fundamental shift in the luxury industry. The general public is becoming more educated, and their decisions about which company to work with are being largely driven by ethics and transparency. This has proven to be a significant opportunity for us, and almost daily we have new clients seeking us out precisely because of our reputation. We have more and more incredible jewelry and watches coming in and are exceptionally excited and optimistic about 2019.”</p>\n<h3>Fortuna Continues to Build Its Reputation in the Vintage Watch Market</h3>\n<p>Session Two: <em>Important Watches</em> offered an eclectic mix of contemporary and vintage watches that fostered competitive bidding from seasoned collectors across Europe, Asia and the Americas. The sale was led by an important Rolex Submariner Ref. 5512 with square crown guards, representing the evolution of the modern Submariner, one of the most recognized watches worn today. The reference 5512 with square crown guards was launched in 1959 to replace earlier models without crown guards, as a way of protecting the crown from impact that could result in water damage to the watch. It is thought that less than 100 examples of the Submariner with square crown guards were made, with only 30 pieces known to the market. This rare vintage timepiece achieved $93,750.</p>\n<div class=\"cols-wrapper cols-2\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<p><img class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rolex-Submariner-5512-Square-Crown-Guards-Close-Up.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col nomargin\">\n<div style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Rolex-Submariner-Ref.-5512-with-Square-Crown-Guards.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rolex Submariner Ref. 5512 with Square Crown Guards</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><br class=\"clear\">Roughly a quarter of the lots were vintage Rolex timepieces, once again distinguishing Fortuna as the collector’s prime source for rare Rolex finds. The Rolex watches achieved a nearly 80% sell-through rate, continuing on the success of Fortuna’s last two watch auctions which each featured a highly sought-after reference 6239 Daytona chronograph with a Paul Newman exotic dial.</p>\n<p>Among other vintage watches also rich in history, an exceedingly rare 1976 Omega Speedmaster Apollo-Soyuz was the subject of contentious bidding<strong>.</strong> One of only 500 timepieces made, the 1976 Omega Speedmaster Apollo-Soyuz commemorates the 1975 docking between the American Apollo and the Soviet Soyuz spacecrafts, a historic moment of thawing of US-Soviet relations during the Cold War. The watch came directly to market from its original owner, who purchased it in France on July 27, 1978. Complete with original receipts, documentation, and service replacement parts, the watch seems almost trapped in time, capturing the excitement of shifting global politics that characterized the late 1970s. A perfect collector’s item, the watch achieved $40,625 USD against a pre-sale estimate of $15,000-$25,000 USD.</p>\n<div class=\"cols-wrapper cols-2\">\n<div class=\"col\">\n<div style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1976-Omega-Speedmaster-Apollo-Soyuz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">1976 Omega Speedmaster Apollo-Soyuz<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">&nbsp;</span></p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col nomargin\">\n<p><img class=\"img-frame aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1976-Omega-Speedmaster-Apollo-Soyuz-Dial-Close-Up.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><br class=\"clear\">Omega watches also performed exceptionally well as a category in Fortuna’s<em> Important Watches</em> auction with a sell-through rate of 80.63% by value. As a whole, the <em>Important Watches</em> sale achieved over $600,000 USD in revenue with an impressive sell-through rate of more than 76%, by value.</p>\n<p>John Saxon expressed optimism for what Fortuna will achieve in the watch industry in the coming years. “Fortuna’s watch department is seeing unprecedented growth, and we already have some exceptional timepieces lined up for next year. What is most exciting, however, is the response we have seen from the watch collecting community. From our previews to watch events, they have shown very strong support. We expect the exponential growth to continue,” said Mr. Saxon.</p>\n<h3>Upcoming Auctions and Announcements</h3>\n<p>In 2016 Fortuna embarked on a mission to revolutionize an industry. In 2017, Fortuna introduced the world to a new category of luxury auctions with the announcement of the Galleria Auctions, and in early 2018 Fortuna hosted a monumental single-owner estate auction for the late Bo Legendre, which achieved an incredible 100% sell-through and made Fortuna the talk of the industry. In 2018, Fortuna also hosted its first ever watch auctions, breaking a world record and creating a new space for watch collectors and enthusiasts to congregate and share their passion with one another. With a packed sale schedule for 2019, Fortuna is actively seeking watch and jewelry consignments. For more information about consigning, please call +1 212-389-9040 to speak with a specialist or click <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/valuation/\">here</a> to&nbsp;request a valuation via our web form.</p>\n<p>As John Saxon, Fortuna’s President and Chief Executive Officer confirms, Fortuna plans to continue building upon this strong momentum in 2019 with a continued pursuit of the core mission. “At the core, our mission to make the world a better place and to achieve great success for everyone that join us on this journey—to bring truth and transparency to industries that lack it; to remove unnecessary roadblocks and speed bumps in flawed business models; to help small businesses grow and better serve their local communities; and to innovate and revolutionize the way that business is done worldwide by continuing to develop our global platform, connecting millions of people to one another. Each year we make great progress forward in the ongoing journey we have embarked on and each year more and more people join us on that journey. We are working on some very exciting innovations right now and have some big announcements coming early next year. We are grateful to those that have chosen to join the Fortuna Family and happy to see them succeed as a result,” said Mr. Saxon.</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>Please note: All prices achieved include buyer’s premiums.</em></p>\n\t\t","date":"2018-12-12T21:57:35.000Z"},{"id":27,"authorId":8,"categoryId":1,"title":"Building Your Watch Collection, with Greg Selch and Eric Wind","content":"<p>We here at Fortuna Auction are excited to present a special interview with Greg Selch and Eric Wind, both established watch collectors who have grown very successful in their hunt for vintage watches of significance.

In particular, the cover lot, a very fine <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-1MGQZC/cartier-669-carat-burmese-sapphire-and-diamond-ring\">Cartier 6.69ct Burmese Sapphire and Diamond Ring</a>, prompted a roar of competitive bidding. The property of a New York lady, the finely crafted ring achieved a final price of $65,625, exceeding a pre-sale estimate of $40,000-$50,000. All in all, jewelry by Cartier and Tiffany &amp; Co. drew the attention of bidders across the globe, achieving sell-through rates by value of 81.5% and 84.6% respectively.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 1090px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Cartier-Unheated-Burmese-Sapphire-and-Diamond-Ring.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"540\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Cartier Unheated Burmese 6.69ct Burmese Sapphire and Diamond Ring. <i>Achieved $65,625 at auction, against a pre-sale estimate of $40,000-$50,000.</i></p></div>\n<p><span id=\"more-4222\"></span></p>\n<p>As a whole, estate pieces also performed very well and demonstrated a sell-through rate by value of nearly 88%.

Newman’s iconic wristwatch singlehandedly saved an entire series of Daytona watches, before setting records itself when it sold. In a high-profile auction, the 1968 Oyster Cosmograph Daytona Paul Newman wore over the decades sold for <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-paul-newman-george-clooney-made-watches-sentimental-1057923\">$17.5 million</a>, setting the record for the <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hylabauer/2017/10/26/paul-newmans-paul-newman-daytona-sells-for-15-5-million-a-record-for-a-wristwatch-at-auction/#267ab8de5313\">highest price ever recorded</a> for a wristwatch to date.</p>\n<p>Not only is the original watch Newman wore highly valuable, but it has also raised the value of similar models of Daytona watches. As an example, a watch of the same reference number as Newman’s Daytona recently sold for <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/2018-sept-post-sale-highlights/\">$275,000 at auction</a>.</p>\n<h2>Who Is Paul Newman &amp; Why Is the “Paul Newman” Daytona So Valuable?</h2>\n<p>Paul Newman, the famous American actor and philanthropist, starred in classic films like <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em>, <em>The Color of Money</em>, <em>The Sting</em> and <em>Cool Hand Luke</em>. Many people know him for his movies, but he also put his stamp on history as a professional race car driver and getting a collection of Rolexes to carry his namesake.<span id=\"more-5191\"></span></p>\n<p>The Rolex Daytona was first introduced in the 1960s, proclaiming Rolex’s sponsorship of the popular Florida racetrack. Despite the design taking inspiration from race car drivers, the timepiece did not speed to the top of the sales charts. Instead, sales faltered and the watch spent a long time only going for $200 on the market. Versions of the first official Daytona models, reference 6239, were also made with an “exotic dial”—featuring large art deco fonts and a red seconds track. It had a distinctly “colorful” look that was quite uncharacteristic of Rolex—further hurting its sales. As a result, a very limited quantity of these exotic dial versions were made.</p>\n<p>Popularity for the Rolex Daytona began to rise when people started seeing Paul Newman wearing an exotic dial reference 6239 Daytona—gifted to him by his wife, Joanne Woodward. As people began to notice the watch on his wrist, demand for it continued to grow. This clamor exploded in the 1980s, when the desire for the exotic dial Rolex Daytona’s hit the collectors’ world.</p>\n<p>Dealers started to take an interest in earlier references of Daytona watches, and termed Daytona’s with the exotic dials “Paul Newman” Daytona’s. The value of these wristwatches has only grown over the years, and the relative scarcity of the “Paul Newman” Daytona’s have made them especially coveted by collector’s at auctions.</p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5286 size-full\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/02-how-to-recognize.png\" alt=\"how to recognize a paul newman\" width=\"904\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/02-how-to-recognize.png 904w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/02-how-to-recognize-300x119.png 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/02-how-to-recognize-768x306.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\"></h2>\n<h2>How to recognize a “Paul Newman” Daytona?</h2>\n<p>If you’re looking to purchase a “Paul Newman” Daytona or want to know how to identify one, you should be aware of a few details. For example, not all reference 6239 Daytona watches are “Paul Newman” Daytonas, and not all “Paul Newman” Daytona’s are reference 6239.</p>\n<p>To get more information on telling the Daytonas apart, consider some of the identifying information listed below.</p>\n<h3>1. Check the Dial</h3>\n<p>The primary difference between a regular Rolex Daytona and a “Paul Newman” Daytona comes down to the design of the dials. The large Art Deco fonts in the sub-dials and the use of red in the outer seconds track differentiate the “exotic” dial from the more simplistic, standard Daytona dials.</p>\n<p>On closer examination, the sub-dials of a “Paul Newman” Daytona will also contain block markers or small squares in the hashmarks, instead of the modern lines commonly seen on most Daytona’s. **You’ll also want to check that the sub-dials all have crosshairs.**</p>\n<p>Another detail to look out for are the numbers on the sub second dial. An authentic “Paul Newman” Daytona will have a sub seconds dial on the left with 15-30-45-60 markers, while other vintage Daytona models will only have 3 markers on their sub seconds dial with the numbers 20, 40 and 60.</p>\n<h3>2. Reference Numbers</h3>\n<p>Vintage Newman Daytona’s will only come in the following reference numbers: 6239, 6241, 6262, 6263, 6264 or 6265—and can range from $100,000 to even over $1 million at auction.</p>\n<p>The reference that Paul Newman wore was a reference 6239, and can be thought of as the most authentic “Paul Newman” Daytona. But because they are also the most numerous of all the “Paul Newman” references, they usually fetch between $100,000 to $200,000—the lower end of the spectrum of value for “Paul Newman” Daytona’s.</p>\n<h3>3. Dial Color Combinations</h3>\n<p>The color of the dial is another way you can tell if it’s an original Newman Daytona. An original Newman Daytona’s dial will come in <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/forbes-new-serious-player-in-high-end-watches-fortuna/\">one of four color combinations</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Panda dial that has a black background and white chronograph totalizer sub-dials</li>\n<li>Inverse panda dial with a white background and black chronograph totalizers</li>\n<li>Inverse panda dial with a cream-colored background and black chronographic totalizers</li>\n<li>Anthracite-colored background paired with white chronograph totalizers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bid on High-End Watches With FORTUNA®</h2>\n<p>As the <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/about-fortuna/\">world’s only no-risk jewelry</a> and watch auction house, FORTUNA has a mission of providing a positive experience for buyers and sellers.

They sparkle. They delight. They adorn. Yet, to a jewelry investor or a gemstone collector, each diamond has a specific value that transcends its natural beauty.</p>\n<p>Auction consignors and their preferred auction houses must, therefore, determine the market value of every diamond. However, approximating a diamond’s likely selling point involves digging deeper into the diamond itself. Below are some of the factors that help indicate how much a diamond is worth within a national or global marketplace.</p>\n<h2>Evaluating the 4Cs of a Diamond</h2>\n<p>Most diamond owners or buyers have heard of the 4Cs: Cut, Clarity, Carat weight and Color. Gemologists and jewelers lean on these four factors to help them define a diamond.</p>\n<p>Without the 4Cs, which were established nearly 70 years ago, diamonds would be challenging to differentiate objectively. The 4Cs provide a solid platform that everyone can agree upon.&nbsp;For instance, the color of a diamond has a strong impact on its worth. Usually, the closer to colorless a diamond is, the more highly it is prized. Therefore, a truly or practically clear diamond will have a better color grade than one with a yellowish tint. However, the color isn’t always bad. The general rule of thumb is, if a diamond is colored, the more intense the color the better.<span id=\"more-5474\"></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/importance-of-gia-diamond-grading/\">Getting a lab report from the Gemological Institute of America (GIA)</a> that confirms the 4Cs may also do wonders in improving the diamond’s market value. The GIA report will show the quality and characteristics of the diamond, which confirms the worth and value of that diamond in the eyes of professional buyers. Yet because of the costs that go into getting a professional lab report, it is always best to consult a professional appraiser first before contacting GIA.</p>\n<p>Although the 4Cs alone do not make up the full value of a diamond, they present a solid starting point. Individuals who own diamonds and want to sell them at auction can always count on being asked to verify the 4Cs of their diamonds. That way, potential buyers understand the type of diamond they are going to bid on during the auction proceedings. Only certified diamond grading professionals can create an authentic diamond grading report.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that all diamonds should be natural when someone is assessing their value. Lab-manufactured or laser drilled diamonds have an artificially improved appearance and clarity, which lowers the value of the diamond.</p>\n<h2><b>Considering the Rarity of a Diamond</b></h2>\n<p>After pinpointing where a diamond falls in terms of the 4Cs, the diamond can then be evaluated for its rarity. In other words, how difficult would it be to find a diamond precisely like this one?</p>\n<p>A great example of a rare diamond would be one that meets the highest standards of all the 4Cs. These types of flawless diamonds do not come up for auction all the time, and collectors realize that. When a rare diamond comes onto the auction block, it usually elicits quite a bit of stir from eager buyers. When it comes to colored diamonds, however, amongst the rarest would be fancy colors such as pink, purple, and <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/blue-diamond-2018/\">blue diamonds</a>.</p>\n<p>Though the starting bid for a rare diamond should be conservatively set, the selling price may go much higher. The reason? Each bidder looks at the basic value of the diamond, and then adds a personal premium for owning the rare gemstone. Again, this is what makes diamond auctions so exciting — diamond values and rarities can be somewhat subjective and at times unpredictable.</p>\n<h2>Looking at Historical Significance to Gauge the Worth of a Diamond</h2>\n<p>Another interesting way that people judge the worth of a diamond is by its history. <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/blue-diamond-2018/\">The Hope Diamond</a> comes to mind as a diamond unparalleled in its historical significance. Of course, any diamond can be important from a historical perspective, especially for collectors who focus on purchasing diamonds from a specific period.</p>\n<p>In general, documentation should accompany any diamond with supposed historical significance. Documents, including images, help assure investors that the diamonds they want to buy have an impressive and traceable lineage.</p>\n<h2>Using the Market as a Litmus Test for Diamond Value</h2>\n<p>As a final note on diamonds and their worth, the marketplace and general economic factors will always have some impact on the selling price for any fine jewelry and gemstones. Nevertheless, expert auction house representatives can usually set a diamond’s worth accurately based on their experience.</p>\n<p>Do you have a diamond you want to sell at auction?

One color that has seen some popularity in recent years is the yellow diamond.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yellow diamonds, sometimes called canary diamonds, are always created by one of two things — the color may be either introduced artificially or found in nature. Natural yellow diamonds get their color from the presence of nitrogen molecules.</p>\n<h2>Is a Yellow Diamond Rare?</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White diamonds are graded from D to Z in terms of purity of color. As they get closer to Z, they take on a yellow hue due to imperfections and decrease in value. Once natural diamonds are completely out of this range, they can take on a deep, rich color and their beauty becomes sublime. These diamonds are referred to as “fancy colored.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only a small percentage of mined diamonds have a deep, true color. Of these, the majority are yellow. Therefore, while natural yellow diamonds are still very rare, they are much easier to find on the market compared to other fancy colored diamonds.<span id=\"more-5569\"></span></p>\n<h2>What are the Different Grades of Yellow Diamonds?</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) grades a yellow diamond, they give the exact color and vividness. The different “color grades” of a yellow diamond include Orange Yellow, Brown Yellow, Green Yellow, and some less common color combinations. Usually, the GIA lists the most prominent color last—e.g. a brown yellow diamond is a yellow diamond with some brown tones.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yellow diamonds are also ranked by vividness, from fancy light to fancy vivid. A diamond may be graded as green yellow and fancy light, meaning it’s a yellow diamond with green hues and is relatively lighter in color.&nbsp;The worth of a yellow diamond changes dramatically depending on its GIA color grade and vividness. For example, a fancy vivid yellow diamond is worth more per carat than fancy light. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4EHuygyhpbc\">Learn more about how saturation affects diamond value.</a></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5577\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5577\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5577 size-medium\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Yellow-Diamond-Nov19-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Graff 15.01ct Fancy Light Yellow Diamond Ring \" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Yellow-Diamond-Nov19-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Yellow-Diamond-Nov19-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Yellow-Diamond-Nov19-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Yellow-Diamond-Nov19-1024x1024.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-5577\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Graff 15.01ct Fancy Light Yellow Diamond Ring.<i> Lot 121, Magnificent Jewels. </i></p></div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b><strong>What Is the Average Value of a Yellow Diamond?</strong></b></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The worth of a yellow diamond varies widely depending on several factors, including:</p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li><b><strong>Clarity:</strong></b>&nbsp;Yellow diamonds, like all diamonds, vary in clarity from “FL” for flawless, the most valuable, down to I2, the most included of diamonds.</li>\n<li><b><strong>Cut:</strong></b>&nbsp;A cut with high polish and good symmetry will make for a valuable diamond. In general, diamonds can be cut and re-cut to maximize value.&nbsp;Occasionally, diamonds may be cut to improve or accentuate its clarity, and that cut will increase the value of the diamond, compared to its original characteristics.</li>\n<li><b><strong>Carat:</strong></b>&nbsp;As with any diamond, the value of a yellow diamond grows with total carat weight.</li>\n<li><b><strong>Fluorescence:</strong></b>&nbsp;Fluorescence refers to whether a diamond emits a glow under UV light. In yellow diamonds, significant fluorescence reduces the value.</li>\n<li><b><strong>Nature:</strong></b>&nbsp;Of course, natural yellow diamonds are worth much more than lab-grown diamonds or any diamond artificially made to appear yellow.</li>\n<li><b><strong>Origin:</strong></b>&nbsp;Some yellow diamonds are especially prized. For example, vivid-grade yellow diamonds from Africa’s Zimmy mine are known for their color and are especially in demand, making their value higher than similarly graded diamonds from different regions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only way to truly know the value of a yellow diamond is to seek a professional appraisal.

After our primary assessment, we will then discuss with you the possibility of submitting your items for certification at the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).</p>\n<h2>What Is a GIA Report?</h2>\n<p>A GIA report is a worldwide recognized diamond grading report. A GIA diamond grading report breaks down the four characteristics of a diamond. It reports a&nbsp;scientific and unbiased assessment stating the diamond’s authenticity. It also states if the diamond has undergone any treatments.</p>\n<p>The report provides information about the diamond for jewelry experts to use to provide a value for your jewelry. GIA diamonds provide more value to your diamond because the diamond now has factual information attached to it. GIA diamond grading allows you to know specific information about the diamond you may have not known before.</p>\n<h2>Why GIA?</h2>\n<p>Even if you’re not in the diamond industry, you’re probably familiar with the 4 C’s of diamond grading: Color, Clarity, Cut, and Carat Weight. These are objective values of a diamond’s characteristics used to determine the value of a diamond. This now internationally adopted metric was created by GIA, as such, they continue to be the most trusted diamond graders in the industry.</p>\n<p>Having a certificate from GIA instills a sense of trust in prospective buyers, for industry professionals know all the extra work a GIA diamond grader puts into collecting information about your stone. They take your diamond or other precious stones out of their mounting and inspect them from every possible angle. A certificate from GIA will increase the value of your item, not because the item is suddenly any different, but because it has undergone a much more thorough inspection by multiple seasoned professionals. After your stones have been observed by all the available channels, your stones will be placed back in their original mounting, exactly how they were before; this is true for big stones on rings, and for small diamonds around a bracelet. GIA reports are not appraisals they are an objective assessment of a diamond’s quality, information which appraisers then use in assigning value.</p>\n<p>In addition to a diamond’s 4Cs information, the Diamond Grading Report provides a plotted diagram of the stone’s clarity characteristics and a graphic representation of its proportions, information which serves to identify the individual stone.</p>\n<h2>How Do You Read a GIA Diamond Report?</h2>\n<p>Each GIA diamond report includes a unique number that can be used to look up the report online. The report has a GIA color scale ranging from D to Z.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>D-F: The diamond is colorless.</li>\n<li>G-J: The diamond has a little color, but is nearly colorless.</li>\n<li>K-M: There is a faint color that may be noticeable to the eye.</li>\n<li>N-R: Color in the diamond is considered very light.</li>\n<li>S-Z: Diamond is considered “light” or on the darker end of the scale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GIA assesses the clarity of the diamond by looking for inclusions and surface blemishes. They include a clarity scale and will assign one of the 11 clarity grades based on amount, size, relief, nature and position.&nbsp;The most prominent clarity characteristics will be shown on a diagrams within the report with a key for each symbol used in the diagrams.&nbsp;GIA has a cut scale ranging from excellent to poor. The cut grade is assigned from seven components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polish</li>\n<li>Symmetry</li>\n<li>Weight Ratio</li>\n<li>Durability</li>\n<li>Brightness</li>\n<li>Fire</li>\n<li>Scintillation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GIA diamond grading report will also include a diagram detailing the exact profile and proportions of the diamond. All four main characteristics including the weight of the diamond in carats are stated in a concise summary under grading results on the report.</p>\n<h2>Who Does a GIA Diamond Report?</h2>\n<p>Employees from GIA conduct the GIA Diamond report. As members of GIA, they do not sell diamonds. GIA is an independent entity only looking at the exact qualities of the gem and providing a report of any changes that may have been made to the diamond. The members hired to investigate and grade the diamonds for the reports. These members include gemologists, research scientists and diamond graders.</p>\n<p>A diamond goes through each type of expert to be cross-checked and analyzed for the most accurate information to be provided on the report GIA gives about each diamond and gem. Each expert will take the gem or diamond out of the mounting to get an accurate carat weight, clarity grade and color grade of the item. The jewel will be placed back into the mounting when the report is completed to look exactly the way it did when it was first sent to GIA.</p>\n<h2>Should I get a GIA Report before submitting my items for consignment?</h2>\n<p>The simple answer is, no. When submitting your items for consignment you should always send us any reports, certifications, proofs of purchase that you <em>already</em> have that could contribute to the value of your item. However, you don’t have to worry about sending your items to GIA, here at Fortuna we provide a preliminary assessment, and then through discussion with you, decide whether a GIA report is necessary to better sell your item. We will never take your item to GIA without your express permission. Once we have the go-ahead from you, we will personally take your item to GIA, pick it up when the report is finished, and make all the arrangements for carefully un-mounting and re-mounting your stone. GIA reports are not always necessary depending on the item, and they also take time to acquire. It is always best to get a professional opinion first, and with Fortuna, we help you take care of all the details.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/contact-us/\">Contact Fortuna Auction for more information about GIA</a>&nbsp;diamond grading reports and the value of your item.</p>\n<h5>For more video content, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FortunaAuction/featured?sub_confirmation=1\">click here to subscribe to Fortuna’s YouTube channel.</a></h5>\n\t\t","date":"2020-01-17T21:58:54.000Z"},{"id":40,"authorId":5,"categoryId":4,"title":"How Fortuna Doubled the Value of a Client’s Fancy Yellow Diamond","content":"<p>There are many things to take into consideration when purchasing a <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/yellow-diamonds-differences-in-grades-value/\">yellow diamond</a>. Yellow diamonds are considered Fancy Colored diamonds, and therefore very rare. Only about 1 in every of 16,500 carats that are mined are yellow diamonds. Amongst these diamonds, there is a spectrum of saturation and vividness of color that contributes to making a yellow diamond more or less valuable. These color grades in order of value are: Fancy Light, Fancy, Fancy Dark, Fancy Deep, Fancy Intense, and Fancy Vivid. And as you can imagine, there is a huge difference in worth between yellow diamonds graded Fancy Light Yellow versus diamonds with a grade of Fancy Vivid Yellow.<span id=\"more-5640\"></span></p>\n<p>The cut of a diamond can have a big influence on the color of a colored diamond when viewed face-up, however, it won’t always necessarily change the overall color grade. When a client came to Fortuna with a 4.5 CT Fancy Yellow diamond ring, our experts recognized the opportunity to increase the value of the diamond by recutting it. Recutting the diamond was no easy decision; if done incorrectly the worth of the diamond could have actually diminished by worsening the color grade or reducing the weight.&nbsp;A major consideration in cutting the stone was being able to maximize its value; the stone had to be cut to increase color vividness and reduce the appearance of inclusions and flaws, all while being cut into a shape that consumers desire. Fortuna is privileged to be in New York City, where the majority of the world’s best diamonds cutters are located.</p>\n<p>Industry experts know that recutting a yellow diamond can increase its value, but not all know how to measure the risk and opportunity associated with doing so. If the consignors of this diamond ring had gone to a jeweler to sell this piece it would have sold for far less than Fortuna achieved. Furthermore, if the jeweler had recognized the opportunity to cut the ring and proceeded to do so successfully, none of the rewards would have gone to the original seller.</p>\n<p>Our team of experts and our superb relationship with master diamond cutters sealed the fate of this diamond ring, once valued at $15,000 with its Fancy Light yellow grade, and managed to sell it at auction for $43,750 as a now Fancy Intense Yellow diamond ring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>For more video content, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FortunaAuction/featured?sub_confirmation=1\">click here to subscribe to Fortuna’s YouTube channel.</a></h5>\n\t\t","date":"2020-01-20T23:09:27.000Z"},{"id":41,"authorId":4,"categoryId":4,"title":"Harry Winston 4.51-Carat Pear-Shaped Diamond Ring","content":"<p>This <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2M9255/harry-winston-451-carat-pear-shaped-diamond-ring\">Harry Winston 4.51-Carat Pear-Shaped Diamond Ring</a> from our upcoming <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-2JZUQV/fine-jewels\"><em>Fine Jewels</em></a>&nbsp;auction, exemplifies the jewelry house’s strive for perfection.

Schlumberger Citrine and Diamond Bird on a Rock Brooch</a> is one of the most iconic designs by the famed French visionary.&nbsp; Jean Schlumberger was deeply inspired by nature and movement. The jeweler traveled far and wide seeking inspiration from then little-seen places like Bali, India, and Thailand. The ‘Bird on a Rock’ is one of the famed French designer’s most iconic pieces. The original ‘Bird on a Rock’ was designed in 1956 with the <em>Tiffany Yellow Diamond</em> in mind, one of the largest yellow diamonds to have ever been discovered. Since then the design has been reissued by Tiffany &amp; Co. still with only large stones as the bird’s perch.&nbsp; <span id=\"more-5739\"></span></p>\n<p>This extraordinary example of Schlumberger’s design from our <em><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-2JZUQV/fine-jewels\">Fine Jewels</a></em> sale is set with an emerald-cut citrine measuring approximately 23.80 x 19.85 x 13.60 mm. The birds on the “Bird on a Rock” brooches are extremely unique; this particular bird sits upon the stunning citrine with a strong gaze ahead, head parallel to the ground.&nbsp; The fowl’s stare is made more intense by the setting of a cabochon ruby as its eye. The Bird’s feathers, which are angled upward as if an act of the wind, are enhanced with round brilliant-cut diamonds weighing approximately 3.00 carats total, most with F-G color and VVS clarity. When hired by Tiffany &amp; Co. to design for them, Schlumberger was told expressly to create as he normally would, with vividity of color and imagination; he remains one of very few designers allowed to sign his work at the brand. The uniting of forces of Tiffany &amp; Co. and Jean Schlumberger elevated the status and possibilities of both parties. With Schlumberger, Tiffany produced creative and expressive designs never before fathomed by the jewelry house. And with Tiffany, Schlumberger had access to a far more expansive supply of quality stones, the likes of which he had never seen.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a class=\"button\" href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/selling/\n\">Sell at Auction&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a class=\"button\" href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/buying/\n\">Buy at Auction</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h5>For more video content, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FortunaAuction/featured?sub_confirmation=1\">click here to subscribe to Fortuna’s YouTube channel.</a></h5>\n<div class=\"pexeto-recent-posts rp-columns\"><h3 class=\"rp-title\">More Video Highlights</h3><div class=\"cols-wrapper cols-2\"><div class=\"col rp\"><div class=\"rp-header\"><a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/fine-alexandrite-and-diamond-ring/\"><img src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ALEXANDRITE-MAIN-1500x1000-1-400x267-570x310.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></div><h4 class=\"rp-post-title\"><a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/fine-alexandrite-and-diamond-ring/\">Fine Alexandrite and Diamond Ring</a></h4><p>Our Tiffany &amp; Co.

Although short-lived, the Art Nouveau style is amongst the most celebrated periods of jewelry design.</h3>\n<p>Lasting only 15 years from 1895 through 1910, the style saw a flourishing of innovative ideas, materials and techniques that propelled jewelry designers into artists, crafting exquisite, often breathtaking jewelry.</p>\n<p>At the turn of the 20th century, the zeitgeist called for bold, new ideas and an abandonment of the historical Victorian precedents of the 19th century in all forms of art, from the decorative arts to music, and architecture to poetry. During this time, colonial expansion by European countries re-opened trade routes with the East, bringing exotic products to the Western world. With widespread industrial production of the decorative arts, poorly made objects often imitating earlier periods were widely available. As a reaction to the overly rigid and somber Victorian period, a rejection of the machine-made and an embrace of Eastern aesthetics, the Art Nouveau style was born. Its masters sought to modernize design, revive quality of production and elevate the status of the artisanship.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-5797\"></span></p>\n<p>The term Art Nouveau was officially born in 1896 when art dealer Samuel Bing renamed his Asian art gallery “La Maison de l’Art Nouveau.” Bringing together a group of artists and designers engaged in a fresh new visual expression, the Parisian art gallery unknowingly gave the name to the movement that would celebrate a renewal of European aesthetics. After the Paris World Fair of 1900, the Art Nouveau style gained such popularity that for a brief moment it was the height of mainstream fashion.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 354px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame \" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nature-flower.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"344\" height=\"344\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art Nouveau Diamond and Enamel Pendant Necklace</p></div>\n<p>The Art Nouveau jewelry style is romantic, feminine and magical. Many pieces of Art Nouveau jewelry are truly works of art, not merely items of adornment showcasing precious stones. The emphasis on the setting, the delicate sensitivity to color, shading and light, as well the use of sensuous lines and contours, and the use of mystical creatures defined the style.</p>\n<p>Diamonds were used sparingly, while moonstone, amethyst, opal, amber, citrine, peridot, and freshwater pearls became popular materials used in the pursuit of creative brilliance. Jewelers developed and experimented with various new enameling techniques as well, most importantly&nbsp;plique-à-jour, a technique that produces thin layers of&nbsp;enamel&nbsp;that have the appearance of&nbsp;stained glass. This unique, three-dimensional technique was very challenging and was a testament to the jeweler’s skill and artistry</p>\n<p>Art Nouveau designs were innovative and intensely creative. Jewelers gained their inspiration from many sources, the foremost influence being the use of nature in Japanese art. Among artist’ favorite motifs were flowers, butterflies and dragonflies, whose delicate petals and wings could be closely mimicked with enamel and a subtle shimmering provided using mixed metals and iridescences of moonstones and opals. The female body and its features were also favored as the perfect display of sinuous lines and delicate turns, to create the impression of flowing movement.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 398px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/286-lot.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"388\" height=\"388\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Masriera y Carreras Art Nouveau Ruby and Plique-a-Jour Enamel Pendant/Brooch</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Rene Lalique, the most celebrated art nouveau designer, championed jewelry that was not used as a vehicle for the display of wealth, “but as an opportunity for creating an object of art no less serious than a painting or sculpture.”1 Born in 1860 and trained as a glass designer, the French artist is known for his creation of vases, chandeliers, perfume bottles, and of course, jewelry. After having worked for Cartier and Boucheron amongst other French jewelry houses, Lalique opened his own business, designing glass objects and jewelry inspired by antiquity and Japonisme. Lalique’s work was made popular among the high society by actress Sarah Bernhardt. In fact, his pieces were regarded as so bold and modern – some depicting naked women – that they were only worn by wealthy, “artistic types.”</p>\n<p>For our December Magnificent Jewels sale, FORTUNA presented a variety of examples of the Art Nouveau style of jewelry, as shown in the video above. They are imaginative pieces, daring and different from other styles and forms. Showcasing Lalique’s preference for more original and fragile materials, a glass and thread necklace displays a delicate and impossibly subtle carving of two women in a pictorial scene, reminiscent of medieval iconography.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 401px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rene-lalique-lot-1130-june-exchange-19.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"391\" height=\"391\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art Nouveau Rene Lalique Emerald Pin</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A striking diamond, pearl and enamel pendant demonstrates how plique-a-jour enamel is used as naturalistic shading and to enhance volume and fullness in the piece. Like many art nouveau pieces, the back of the pendant proves as much attention to detail as the front. Much to the viewer’s satisfaction, the pendant can be turned to reveal the female figures’ alternate side, adding an unexpected point of interest.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The effectiveness and versatility of the enameling technique developed during this era, are also demonstrated in both the dragonfly and the feather pins, two more wearable examples because of their petite scale. A playful citrine and green tourmaline necklace illustrates perfectly how even abstract Art Nouveau pieces would be brought to life through the use of color and sinuous curves.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Taking the time to observe these pieces, there can be no doubt as to the importance of the Art Nouveau period in ushering in 20th-century design and with it, a multiplicity of new techniques and creative achievements. It is through the Art Nouveau style that the jeweler breaks from the traditional confinements of adornment, to find a true form of artistic expression.</p>\n<h5>For more video content, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FortunaAuction/featured?sub_confirmation=1\">click here to subscribe to FORTUNA’s YouTube channel.</a></h5>\n\t\t","date":"2020-02-04T17:33:03.000Z"},{"id":44,"authorId":5,"categoryId":3,"title":"The Origins of the Van Cleef & Arpels Alhambra Collection","content":"<p>Van Cleef &amp; Arpels’s opened the Parisian “La Boutique,” in 1954, which was meant to offer more accessible fine jewelry for young women to wear. This burgeoned the creativity that would eventually lead to the creation of the jewelry house’s most iconic collection, the Alhambra, in 1968. The craftsmen at VCA could not have anticipated the sweeping change that this new line would bring from 1968 and onward.</p>\n<p>That year saw the introduction of the VCA Alhambra design, with a shape reminiscent of a four-leaf clover crafted from beaded edges. A long necklace adorned with 20 motifs debuted the collection, the origin of an emblematic style for the jeweler that since proliferated and endures today.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Is the Van Cleef &amp; Arpels Alhambra Design?</h2>\n<p>The Alhambra collection likely received its namesake from the palace and fortress in Granada, Spain, whose sweeping ornate archways are said to have been the inspiration.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 387px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Grace-Kelly.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"377\" height=\"572\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Princess Consort Grace Kelly of Monaco wearing two strands of Van Cleef and Arpels Alhambra necklaces in 1977.</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The design resembles the four overlapping circles of Moorish quatrefoil decorations—traditional signs of good luck— so the symbol had small appearances in jewelry during the 1920s as a talisman.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“To be lucky you have to believe in luck.”</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;\">—Jacques Arpels, who was fond of including symbols of luck in many of his designs.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Alhambra motif could also be described as a four-leaf clover, which the artisan collected in his garden in Germigny-l’Évêque just northeast of Paris.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The collection became a celebrity favorite throughout the 1970s. Former Hollywood star and Princess of Monaco, Grace Kelly was particularly fond of the iconic design, oftentimes wearing more than one strand of Alhambra necklaces at once.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Alhambra motif has been revived every decade since its induction, utilizing new gemstones, such as chalcedony, carnelian, tiger’s eye and diamond, building upon the design’s versatility. Royalty and celebrities alike remain partial to the designs; the Duchess of Cambridge wore them just a few weeks ago at the BAFTA awards, and Reese Witherspoon can be spotted wearing them casually while out walking through Los Angeles. The versatility of the piece is a testament to the skill of the artisans and their incredible eye for design.</p>\n<h2>What’s the Most Sought-After Van Cleef &amp; Arpels Alhambra Piece?</h2>\n<p>Some of the most prized VCA Alhambra pieces include the opera-length necklaces in the Vintage Alhambra collection, a reproduction of the design’s first editions. The Magic Alhambra collection uses a bold, asymmetrical design for the modern-day.&nbsp; Chains of white, yellow or rose gold set with up to 20 diamond motifs are the most expensive pieces in these collections.</p>\n<p>The turquoise Alhambra set, first introduced in the ’60s has been notoriously difficult to find as turquoise that meets the jewelry maison’s quality standard is hard to come by.</p>\n<h2>Are There Still Pieces Being Made?</h2>\n<p>The most recent releases featuring the Alhambra included four models of long necklaces and bracelets introduced at the collection’s 50th-anniversary celebration in 2018. Their design also follows the original, this time set with diamonds or rock crystals with grey mother-of-pearl, lapis lazuli or onyx.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/vca2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vintage Alhambra Necklace with Yellow Gols and Diamond motifs from Timecraft Exchange</p></div>\n<p>Today, wearers of VCA jewelry have a variety of materials, sizes and gems to choose from.

Enamel is a decorative coating applied to a metal; and in Webb’s case, his metal of choice was usually yellow gold. The contrast of bright yellow gold with his enamel detailing creates a bold look that is quintessential Webb—as seen in a couple of FORTUNA’s David Webb offerings: a whimsical <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2Q7V06/david-webb-ruby-and-enamel-frog-brooch\">Ruby and Enamel Frog Brooch</a>&nbsp;which pairs beautifully with the bold&nbsp;<a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2Q7V4B/david-webb-enamel-bangle\">Enamel Bangle.</a></p>\n<p>Perhaps the jewelry that Webb is most known for are his wide-ranging collection of animal bracelets, brooches and pins.

By 1963 the jewelry house had designed enough imaginative animal motifs to form an animal kingdom of their own.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-V9K57/david-webb-diamond-and-ruby-horse-bracelet\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61339305-edf20cf76790b2cc64d5d1c850017237526b363c2d52da401a9a657d01c6c42b-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8658\" width=\"474\" height=\"474\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61339305-edf20cf76790b2cc64d5d1c850017237526b363c2d52da401a9a657d01c6c42b-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61339305-edf20cf76790b2cc64d5d1c850017237526b363c2d52da401a9a657d01c6c42b-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61339305-edf20cf76790b2cc64d5d1c850017237526b363c2d52da401a9a657d01c6c42b-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61339305-edf20cf76790b2cc64d5d1c850017237526b363c2d52da401a9a657d01c6c42b-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61339305-edf20cf76790b2cc64d5d1c850017237526b363c2d52da401a9a657d01c6c42b-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/61339305-edf20cf76790b2cc64d5d1c850017237526b363c2d52da401a9a657d01c6c42b-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\"></a><figcaption>David Webb Diamond and Ruby Horse Bracelet, achieved $34,375 at auction.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>A History of David Webb</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the many iconic craftsmen that paved the way for modern jewelry as we know it, David Webb stands out as a true original. His one-of-a-kind eye for design and detail rose to fame amid the glamor of the 1960s, yet his history begins decades earlier with his birth in 1925. Born and raised in Asheville, North Carolina, Webb’s love for fine metal began with an early apprenticeship in a silversmith’s shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This passion was fueled by an early move to New York, where he repaired jewelry in Greenwich Village.&nbsp;Webb soon rose in the ranks of popularity amid New York’s social elite, quickly creating a name for himself. This reputation for excellence enabled him to open his own shop and establish David Webb Inc. in 1948.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/David-Webb-Hammered-Gold-Rings-1500x1000-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8643\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/David-Webb-Hammered-Gold-Rings-1500x1000-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/David-Webb-Hammered-Gold-Rings-1500x1000-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/David-Webb-Hammered-Gold-Rings-1500x1000-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/David-Webb-Hammered-Gold-Rings-1500x1000-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/David-Webb-Hammered-Gold-Rings-1500x1000-1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>A pair of bold David Webb Gold Rings offered in FORTUNA’s 2017 <em>Important Jewels</em> auction.

He incorporated design elements borrowed throughout the ages, adding modern twists to create pieces that can only be described as timeless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His incorporation of animal themes — inspired by his favorite pets — was lauded by the biggest stars from coast to coast. David Webb drew deep inspiration from the world around him, from history and architecture to the human spirit — an inspiration that’s visible in every piece he crafted.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enduring Legacy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1975, David Webb’s company had produced a variety of winning collections, spanning in style from stunning diamond bracelets to totem pieces and hand-painted enamel jewelry pieces. His standout success earned David Webb several features on the most reputed fashion magazines of his time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tragically, his legendary career was cut short when he passed away from pancreatic cancer at the age of 50. David Webb Inc. has continued to carry out his legacy with a selection of jewels that embody the same spirit, creativity and boldness that set Webb’s original pieces apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-13O0UN/david-webb-enamel-necklace\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/retrievePhoto-52-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8645\" width=\"506\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/retrievePhoto-52-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/retrievePhoto-52-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/retrievePhoto-52-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/retrievePhoto-52-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/retrievePhoto-52-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/retrievePhoto-52-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\"></a><figcaption>David Webb Geometric Enamel Necklace, achieved $18,125 in FORTUNA’s June 2018 <em>Fine Jewels</em> auction.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-3BVHCB/david-webb-diamond-and-enamel-broochpendant\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/115179902-7ac0cb84d030e18caf132f1f023a8d18d1a5edd68cd78cc12369e5bd619dd503-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8644\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/115179902-7ac0cb84d030e18caf132f1f023a8d18d1a5edd68cd78cc12369e5bd619dd503-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/115179902-7ac0cb84d030e18caf132f1f023a8d18d1a5edd68cd78cc12369e5bd619dd503-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/115179902-7ac0cb84d030e18caf132f1f023a8d18d1a5edd68cd78cc12369e5bd619dd503-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/115179902-7ac0cb84d030e18caf132f1f023a8d18d1a5edd68cd78cc12369e5bd619dd503-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/115179902-7ac0cb84d030e18caf132f1f023a8d18d1a5edd68cd78cc12369e5bd619dd503-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/115179902-7ac0cb84d030e18caf132f1f023a8d18d1a5edd68cd78cc12369e5bd619dd503-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>David Webb Diamond and Enamel Brooch/Pendant, achieved $9,375 in August 2020<em> Jewels &amp; Watches</em>.</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2WUO8C/david-webb-black-enamel-door-knocker-earclips\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/107210065-3bca06d7e499b27df9f47e21b8a0268493b0b8714e7b552f7085b315e380e5e0-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8646\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/107210065-3bca06d7e499b27df9f47e21b8a0268493b0b8714e7b552f7085b315e380e5e0-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/107210065-3bca06d7e499b27df9f47e21b8a0268493b0b8714e7b552f7085b315e380e5e0-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/107210065-3bca06d7e499b27df9f47e21b8a0268493b0b8714e7b552f7085b315e380e5e0-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/107210065-3bca06d7e499b27df9f47e21b8a0268493b0b8714e7b552f7085b315e380e5e0-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/107210065-3bca06d7e499b27df9f47e21b8a0268493b0b8714e7b552f7085b315e380e5e0-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/107210065-3bca06d7e499b27df9f47e21b8a0268493b0b8714e7b552f7085b315e380e5e0-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>David Webb Black Enamel Door Knocker Earclips, achieved $8,750 in June 2020 <em>Jewels</em>.</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>An Inside Look Into David Webb’s Iconic Pieces</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bold.

One year later, the company launched its Cosmograph Reference 6239, a chronograph watch that evolved into the Daytona we all know and love today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many celebrities and watch collectors, including actor and racer <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/rolex-daytona-paul-newman-what-it-is-and-why-its-so-valuable/\">Paul Newman</a>, have been big fans of the Daytona. These watches were created specifically for car racers and have undergone many different styles in their 55-year history. And in the time before Rolex was completely vertically integrated in their production, vintage Daytonas are chockfull of design inconsistencies that have set the vintage watch world abuzz. We’ve put together a small list of some of our favorite Daytona dial variations that have grown significantly in value over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:39px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-5933\"></span>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our Favorite Daytona Dials &amp; What Makes Them So Special</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The dial of a Rolex dramatically changes the aesthetic of the timepiece and is what really gives the watch character. Over time, Rolex Daytona watches have featured a number of unique dials that have become important for collectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3>Big Red vs. Small Red</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in 1970, Daytona references 6263 and 6265 were introduced, featuring large screw-down pushers that gave the watch a much more heavy-duty and larger appearance. These two references possessed a myriad of dial variations, with some dials that completely omitted the “Daytona” moniker. Of the dials that did include the “Daytona” text, the bright red serif fonts appear just above the middle sub-register in two font sizes: large or small. The Daytona “Big Red” and “Small Red” are both highly prized by collectors and comes in silver or black dials with contrasting sub-dials. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2U42Y6/rolex-big-red-daytona-ref-6265-in-steel\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for more information on an example offered this April at auction!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at some examples of “Big Red” Daytona’s that FORTUNA® has offered at auction. The “Daytona” text extends well beyond the two hour markers on either side of the “12” in the sub-register. The text on “Small Red” Daytona’s do not extend as widely as the “Big Reds.”  </p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rolex-Daytona-Cosmograph-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2726\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rolex-Daytona-Cosmograph-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rolex-Daytona-Cosmograph-366x244.jpg 366w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rolex-Daytona-Cosmograph-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rolex-Daytona-Cosmograph-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rolex-Daytona-Cosmograph.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Rolex Daytona “Big Red” Ref. 6265. <i>Achieved $71,875 at FORTUNA® (April 2018).</i></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2U42Y6/rolex-big-red-daytona-ref-6265-in-steel\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-1-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6446\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-1-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Rolex Daytona “Big Red” Ref. 6265 in Steel. <em>Achieved $68,750 at FORTUNA (April 2020)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2U42Y6/rolex-big-red-daytona-ref-6265-in-steel\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-Close-Up-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6447\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-Close-Up-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-Close-Up-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-Close-Up-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-Close-Up-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Daytona-Big-Red-Close-Up.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Close-up of the “Big Red” dial, with the bold red “Daytona” text in a larger font-size</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Four-Line Daytona</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, the circa 1988 Daytona reference 16520 is rare, with the early bezel graduated to 200 units per hour—prior to Rolex increasing the bezel to 400 units per hour to keep up with the faster drivers of the period. This Daytona followed the end of the porcelain dial automatic Daytona.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The “Four-Line” Daytona Ref. 16520—also referred to as the “Mark 2” dial—is an early run in which Rolex may have been testing fewer words on this dial than previous designs, so the watch reads “Superlative Chronometer” with “Officially Certified” noticeably missing. The ref. 16520 also features an upside-down “6” in the center sub-register, resembling a nine more than a six. This is considered a small design flaw which actually makes the piece more valuable to collectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-1A0I2G/rolex-four-line-zenith-daytona-ref-16520-in-steel\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Four-Line-Daytona-2-e1587414151989-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6435\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Four-Line-Daytona-2-e1587414151989-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Four-Line-Daytona-2-e1587414151989-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Four-Line-Daytona-2-e1587414151989-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Four-Line-Daytona-2-e1587414151989-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Four-Line-Daytona-2-e1587414151989.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Rolex “Four-Line” “Zenith” Daytona Ref. 16520.

Singer was actually the manufacturer of this dial before Rolex made its components in-house. Originally called exotic dials, the designs feature large Art Deco numerals and used 15-30-45-60 markers in the seconds sub-dial, instead of the more typical 20-40-60. These dials also have square markers in the subsidiary registers and a bright red minute track surrounding the dial, making the watch look “funkier” compared to the minimalist dials found on the typical Daytona of the time. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2U42Y8/rolex-daytona-paul-newman-ref-6239-in-steel\" target=\"_blank\">Click here for more information on a “Paul Newman” Daytona coming up for auction this April!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though not initially popular, these dials received a second life once they were popularized by Paul Newman. Their extreme rarity also contributes to their significant rise in value over their years. In fact, Paul Newman’s own “Paul Newman” Daytona Ref. 6239 broke auction records when the wristwatch sold in 2017 for $17.8 million. The model is still commonly known today as the “Paul Newman” and is worth roughly 4-5 times more than the standard Ref. 6239, without the “Paul Newman” dial. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2U42Y8/rolex-daytona-paul-newman-ref-6239-in-steel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Paul-Newman-Daytona-6239-Black-Dial-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Rolex Paul Newman Daytona 6239 Black Dial -

The varnish proved to not offer adequate protection, and the effects of UV and oxidation turned the silver dials brown. The watches gain a deeper shade with time, and no two watches have aged the same way, so color variations make each piece unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, collectors especially prize this earlier version of the Ref. 16520, especially since Rolex made very few of them for its imperfect dial. Like the “Four-Line” Daytona, the six is upside down in the hours sub-register, making it appear as a nine—yet another design flaw.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6460\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>The “Patrizzi” dial is one of the most sought-after design anomalies in vintage Rolexes. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-Close-Up-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6461\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-Close-Up-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-Close-Up-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-Close-Up-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-Close-Up-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Patrizzi-Dial-2-Close-Up.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Close-up of the “Patrizzi” dial, with the brown coloration in the sub-register rims.</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zenith Daytona’s</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolex wasn’t always the vertically integrated company we know today.

The necklace and bracelet adapts Bulgari’s modular design concept to a more glamorous night time look, using inspirations from their past “Boules” (or beads) line with the use of white gold beads.&nbsp;In the 1980’s Bulgari was also one of the first to create matching sets of jewelry, like this necklace and bracelet but selling them separately, understanding the modern woman’s desire to choose whether she wanted to mix or match. The matching necklace and bracelet are sold separately but they sure do look lovely together!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignwide\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2><strong>Art Deco Diamond &amp; Emerald Bracelet</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h5>Why we love it:</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The opulence and fine craftsmanship seen in Art Deco jewelry is what makes them absolute favorites at FORTUNA®.&nbsp;The sleek, geometric design seen in this piece is quite popular in many Art Deco jewels.

The impressive 128.54-Carat Fancy Yellow Diamond was famously worn by Audrey Hepburn, and most recently, by Lady Gaga at the 2019 Oscars. Fancy Yellow diamonds occur much more rarely in nature than white diamonds, so their usage may not be as widespread in jewelry designs.

Throughout history, the events of the times left a definite impact on how designers used metals and gemstones in their jewelry creations, as well as what motifs and features became vogue. In analyzing jewelry, the themes are clear and speak to the story of how jewelry evolved with the ages.</p>\n<h2>What Is Considered Antique Jewelry?</h2>\n<p>A piece gets the “antique” label if&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/19/10.53\">it is more than 100 years old</a>, so every year, more pieces become antiques. Read our quick guide on the different types of antique jewelry.</p>\n<h3>Victorian Jewelry</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/victorian-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Victorian Diamond Pendant Necklace , achieved $2,250 at our February 2020 Fine Jewels sale</p></div>\n<p>The monarch Queen Victoria inspired many of the tastes of this period. These pieces are considered sentimental and include brooches, link bracelets, fans and hair jewelry.</p>\n<p>Early in her reign, pieces took floral inspiration or were otherwise symbolic of flowers. Gold was a popular metal since different plating techniques had been invented. Designers used gemstones including amethyst and garnet.</p>\n<p>In the mid-century, when Prince Albert died, Queen Victoria went into mourning. Jewelry made during this time was black with bold designs and gold with black enamel.&nbsp;After this, jewelry styles from the Renaissance and Gothic periods came into favor.</p>\n<p>Later in the century, silver became the popular metal, and diamonds and pearls became the popular gemstones.</p>\n<h3>Art Nouveau Jewelry</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-1GICGL/art-nouveau-diamond-and-enamel-pendant-necklace\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nouveau-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Art Nouveau Diamond and Enamel Pendant Necklace, achieved $10,000 at our December Magnificent Jewels sale, 2018</p></div>\n<p>This period includes the dawn of the 20th century and its first decade. Designs were rebellious against the excess of the Victorian-era styles. Designers used unconventional materials, such as glass or enamel, and created pieces by hand, setting aside the ways of the industrial age and discourage mass production. Many jewelry designs were likened to works of art in the hands of a sculptor.</p>\n<p>Pendants, necklaces and hair ornaments were the famous pieces of this time, and their designs were inspired by natural elements. Dragonflies, flowing hair, female figures, plants and flowers were common. These designs favored curved silhouettes and incorporated elements like silver, enamel, moonstones, horn and natural materials.</p>\n<h3>Art Deco Jewelry</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-T02YW/cartier-art-deco-colombian-emerald-and-diamond-platinum-bracelet\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" title=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-T02YW/cartier-art-deco-colombian-emerald-and-diamond-platinum-bracelet\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/deco-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cartier Art Deco Colombian Emerald and Diamond Bracelet, achieved $237,500 at our sale of the Estate of Bo Legendre</p></div>\n<p>This style thrived in the years between World War I and II and reflected the opulence and extravagance of the Roaring Twenties. Music and art inspired the design of pieces. The Jazz Age prompted the use of color and shapes, as well as oriental and exotic elements presented in simple, angular, geometric forms.</p>\n<p>White gold and platinum were common metals, and diamonds were heavily utilized to create utterly stunning pieces that glittered with every square inch. Popular pieces included long earrings, rings, stacked bracelets and flapper beads, often worn together shirking any attitude of “less is more” leftover from the War, and replacing it with “joie de vivre.”</p>\n<h3>Retro Jewelry</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2H4SNM/van-cleef-arpels-retro-diamond-bracelet\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/retro-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Van Cleef &amp; Arpels Retro Diamond Bracelet, achieved $43,750 at our December 2019 Important Jewels Sale</p></div>\n<p>World War II left an impact on this period of jewelry design. While the men were off to war, women found jobs in the workplace. With the rise of the working woman, jewelry and fashion became popular. Before the 1940s, platinum was the popular jewelry metal. However, the war made it scarce. As a result, designs from this period favored the usage of gold and rose gold.</p>\n<p>Pieces from this era use bold and chunky designs of floral patterns. Colored gemstones like aquamarine and topaz were common, and clip-on earrings that were close to or just below the ear became trendy.</p>\n<h2>Buy or Sell Antiques With FORTUNA®</h2>\n<p>FORTUNA is the only no-risk fine jewelry and watch auction house in the world.

The history of the Cartier Panthère began with one woman—Jeanne Toussaint. When Toussaint, a Parisian style icon, became acquainted with French jeweler Louis Cartier, new inspiration for Cartier’s famous jewelry line was born. As a result of Toussaint’s elegance and remarkable determination—as well as her finely decorated apartment adorned with leopard skin—she earned the nickname “La Panthère” from her then-lover, Louis Cartier.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cartier_jeanne-toussaint1.jpg\" alt=\"jeanne toussiant\n\" class=\"wp-image-6969\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cartier_jeanne-toussaint1.jpg 1000w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cartier_jeanne-toussaint1-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cartier_jeanne-toussaint1-768x544.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"><figcaption>Jeanne Toussiant in her Cartier office at 13 rue de la Paix in Paris. Private Collection © Cartier</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as a nickname became the basis of one of Cartier’s most stunning developments in jewelry pieces—the Cartier Panthère wristwatch. Toussaint was soon named Head of Creation at <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/tag/cartier/\">Cartier</a>, a coveted position that wouldn’t ordinarily have been held by a woman; her contributions led the company to even greater success throughout the 1900s. Toussaint’s panther was known for its stunningly sculpted yellow gold and black enamel—a color combination that gave the animal more dimension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1914, the famous wildcat appeared on a Cartier wristwatch for the first time. The stones adorning the piece symbolized the feminine temperament and avant-garde allure of the panther, while the diamond’s scintillation was a nod to the wildcat’s gleaming coat.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Artboard-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Cartier Watch\n\" class=\"wp-image-7009\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Artboard-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Artboard-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Artboard-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Artboard-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Artboard-1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>The first noted appearance of the panther pattern on a Cartier ladies’ wristwatch in 1914. Courtesy of Cartier Archives.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Toussaint’s inspiration, Cartier’s idea to incorporate the panther motif into his jewelry pieces earned him full acclaim in nobility circles. In addition to being the first jeweler to incorporate the panther motif as a trademark on his exclusive timepieces, Cartier was one of the first jewelers to use platinum in his luxurious creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cartier’s elegant panther has endured for more than a century, in part because the Cartier Panthère continues to evolve. In a careful attempt to lend justice to the original piece, artisans sculpt each example in wax, cast the ornament in platinum or gold, then set the piece with thousands of hand-cut gemstones painstakingly positioned to convey movement and life.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Closer Look at Louis Cartier: The Stirrings of the Cartier Panthère</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In taking over the craft of his master, Louis-François Cartier founded his own company in 1847 Paris. His inventiveness and daring capacity to try new things led him to create exclusive, exquisite timepieces revered among the nobility of the time. His attention to detail and supreme level of craftsmanship drew the eye of the French empress Eugenie, among other socialites. As a result, his company expanded rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cartier loved to try his hand at a variety of jewelry pieces, and in 1888, he presented his first wristwatch to the public. The watch closely resembled the sleek, classic feminine bracelets of that time. The difference? His addition of a small clock in the design. Following the initial inspiration of this first wristwatch, Cartier was driven to completely revitalize all aspects of watch design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may have been this initial curiosity that paved the way for Cartier’s inspired collaboration with Toussaint, as well as his subsequent fascination with the panther. Today, Cartier’s timeless pieces continue to be passed down from one generation to the next. The Cartier Panthère remains an iconic, desirable design of the most serious artistic expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Timeline History of the Cartier Panthère</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand how the Cartier Panthère came about and how the bold motif has evolved over the years, we’ve put together a timeline of the iconic design:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1914:&nbsp;</strong>Cartier crafts the first panther pattern on a wristwatch and presents it to the public. The watch was adorned with white diamonds, spotted with striking onyx stones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1922-1935:</strong>&nbsp;The spotted panther motif starts appearing on various Cartier watches, jewelry designs, and accessories, such as cigarette cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:66.66%\">\n<p><strong>1948:</strong>&nbsp;The Duchess of Windsor tasks Jeanne Toussaint with creating a panther brooch and the first three-dimensional representation of the panther is born. The sculptural approach with the panther design redefines how Cartier breathes life and personality into their future panther creations. The Duchess of Windsor, being so taken by the iconic feline, later purchases more than six additional panther designs. The most famous pieces are the panther brooch of pavé diamonds and sapphires, perched atop a 152.35ct sapphire cabochon, and an onyx and diamond panther bracelet, which most recently achieved over $7 million at auction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1949-1950:</strong>&nbsp;American heiress, Barbara Hutton and French socialite, Daisy Fellowes, among other fashionable aristocrats, begin investing in their own versions of the panther.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:33.33%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cartier.eu/content/dam/cartier_dam/Communication%20assets/timeline/1949-1.png\" alt=\"jewelry for duchess of windsor\" width=\"176\" height=\"247\"><figcaption>Completed in 1949 for the Duchess of Windsor.

Although a ladies’ watch, the fine yellow gold link bracelet perfectly matched the 80s “glam” aesthetic, and the watch quickly saw an upsurge in popularity—featuring notable celebrity wearers, such as Keith Richard and Pierce Brosnan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2005:</strong> Introduction of the Panthère de Cartier ring with its fangs bared. It is the first appearance of the Cartier panther in a stylized, faceted design. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cartier.com/content/dam/cartier_dam/Communication%20assets/timeline/2005.jpg\" alt=\"cartier panther\n\" width=\"375\" height=\"323\"><figcaption>A geometric, modern take on the panther motif.

The beautiful underwater gem is found in mollusks and clams and is the only precious stone to come from a living creature. Their association with bodies of water makes them an apt choice for a summertime birthstone; however, pearls have held significance throughout jewelry history, long before birthstone months existed. In Persian mythology, pearls were thought to be the “tears of the gods,” while ancient Chinese legend held that the moon used powers to create pearls in order to mirror the moon’s celestial glow and mystery.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“I feel undressed if I don’t have my&nbsp;pearls&nbsp;on. My&nbsp;pearls&nbsp;are my security blanket.”</p><cite><em>Lady&nbsp;Sarah Churchill</em></cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What augments the allure of pearls even further is the infinitesimal chance of them existing naturally. Pearls occur in nature by the presence of an irritant within the mollusk or oyster, which may be a parasite or even a single grain of sand that has made its way into the shell. The mollusk produces a coating layer called “nacre.” It takes many months, even years, for the oyster to produce a pearl. The acquisition of natural pearls requires long dives into the ocean’s depths, most of which prove to be fruitless. Only 1 in about 10,000 wild&nbsp;oysters&nbsp;will yield a&nbsp;pearl, and even fewer will produce a pearl of gem quality. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, contemporary jewelers have almost entirely relied on the cultured pearl industry to source pearls. Pearl culturing is when pearl farmers inject an irritant into mollusks for the specific purpose of producing pearls. This method does away with the need for long and dangerous dives in search of the pearls. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pearls that Shaped History</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be a huge disservice to discuss pearls and fail to mention Cartier and arguably the most famous example of pearl jewelry. While Cartier is renowned worldwide for its long history of jewelry excellence, a large part of their legacy is owed to pearls. You may be running through a list of iconic Cartier pieces in your mind: the Love Bracelet, the Panthère d’Cartier, etc. But if you think bigger, you’ll picture the famous Fifth Avenue Cartier mansion, a New York landmark. Remarkably, the impetus behind Cartier’s monumental acquisition of this iconic structure can be attributed to two strands of pearls.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pearl.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7032\" width=\"478\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pearl.jpg 700w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pearl-256x300.jpg 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px\"><figcaption>Portrait of Mrs. Mae Caldwell Manwaring Plant Rovensky, wearing the famed Cartier pearl necklace.&nbsp;Courtesy of Preservation Society of Newport County</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1909, Pierre Cartier arrived to New York in an exciting attempt to bring Cartier to the forefront of the American market. He set up a small office on 5th Avenue to sell his brother’s creations. It wasn’t until Maisie Plant set her eyes on a Cartier double strand pearl necklace that the French jeweler had the opportunity for such a magnificent piece of real estate. Maisie was the young wife of a very wealthy and eager-to-please man, Morton F. Plant, the heir to the Plant railroad and steamship empire, and she desperately wanted the coveted necklace. Mr. Plant agreed to exchange his Renaissance-style mansion on the corner of 5th Avenue and 52nd Street for what was widely believed to be the most expensive pearl necklace in the world, composed of two strands of enormous natural South Sea pearls, one consisting of 55 pearls; and the other, 73 perfect pearls—estimated to be over $20 million in today’s dollars. Even for a jeweler of such prestige, it was no easy feat for Cartier to acquire such a necklace. With the exchange, the old 5-story townhouse was converted into the New York Headquarters for Cartier, and remains so today.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Pearls are always appropriate.”</p><cite><em>Jackie Kennedy</em><br></cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our Favorite Pearl Jewels Seen At Auction</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Cartier Art Deco Natural Pearl Diamond and Rock Crystal Platinum</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Art-Deco-Cartier-Pearl-Bracelet-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3273\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Art-Deco-Cartier-Pearl-Bracelet-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Art-Deco-Cartier-Pearl-Bracelet-366x244.jpg 366w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Art-Deco-Cartier-Pearl-Bracelet-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Art-Deco-Cartier-Pearl-Bracelet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Art-Deco-Cartier-Pearl-Bracelet.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Achieved $140,625 at FORTUNA®’s June <em>Fine Jewels</em> auction in 2018.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Cartier Art Deco Natural Pearl Diamond and Rock Crystal Platinum Bracelet was crafted in the same era as Maisie’s beloved necklace. The Art Deco era saw a combination of seemingly clashing materials resulting in wonderful designs.

The delicate, fluid pearl strands make a bold statement when combined with the rock crystal and diamond accents. This incredible piece of history and artistry was estimated to sell at auction for between&nbsp;$50,000 – $70,000.

Discover the alluring qualities of this rare gemstone and some of Fortuna’s favorite ruby jewels offered in past auctions.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortuna is excited to delve deeper into the history and lore of July’s birthstone, the magnificent ruby. Because of the deep blood-like color, the precious gemstone has been thought to hold the power of life in ancient cultures. The stone was believed to protect the lands of kings and noblemen in ancient India, and has long been perceived as a symbol of royalty in medieval Europe. In fact, the literal translation of “ruby” in Sanskrit is the “king of gemstones.” The deep red tint of the ruby has naturally also come to symbolize love and passion and has become the gemstone of choice in romantic gifts. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Rubies in Popular Culture</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubies have such a long and rich history of being appreciated in both the East and West, it is no wonder that their influence stretches into cinema and popular culture. One of our favorite examples would be the iconic ruby red slippers worn by Dorothy in the “Wizard of Oz.” While the original ruby slipper were actually made of felt, glue, and stones more suitable to crafting, for the 50th anniversary of the film, Harry Winston jewelers created a real-life pair of the iconic slippers—using 50 carats of diamonds and nearly 1,400 carats of rubies. And thus, the famed American jewelry house created the most expensive pair of shoes in the world. The slippers, which were meticulously set with 4,600 beautiful ruby stones, is valued at $3 million.<br>Rubies have also made their way into your favorite rom-coms. In the 1990 film “Pretty Woman,” Richard Gere gifts Julia Roberts with an accessory as red as her hair. The wealthy tycoon presents her with a custom ruby necklace set with 23 pear-cut rubies. And unlike most movie props, the necklace was actually real—custom made by French jeweler, Fred Joaillier. It consisted of 23 pear-shaped rubies accented by diamonds in the form of a heart. This scene was made all the more iconic by Gere’s snapping the box shut on Ms. Roberts’s fingers as she goes to put on the lavish accessory.

Our top jewelry specialists knew a select group of pieces had to be the work of the master jeweler of the early 20th century, <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/suzanne-belperron/\">Suzanne Belperron</a>. Belperron believed her style to be her signature, and while she was right, it made it extremely difficult to authenticate her works.

The brooch is set in platinum, displaying beautiful cabochon rubies weighing a total of approximately 5.90 carats, and round brilliant-cut diamonds weighing a total of approximately 0.20 carat, with I-J color and VS clarity. The unique design can be worn as a brooch fastened by double pin-stems or attached to an 18K white gold cuff. This wondrous piece was offered for $10,000; but with Belperron’s name attributed to the design, the lot ended up achieving $78,125 at auction.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>A 2.34-CARAT UNHEATED BURMESE RUBY AND DIAMOND RING</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lot307-Item3-e1593781839573-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2066\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lot307-Item3-e1593781839573-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lot307-Item3-e1593781839573-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lot307-Item3-e1593781839573-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lot307-Item3-e1593781839573.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>A Superb 2.34-Carat Unheated Burmese Ruby and Diamond Ring. <em>Sold for $48,800</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring a very lively, unheated Burmese cushion-cut ruby, this 2.34-Carat Ruby and Diamond Ring achieved more than double its starting bid at Fortuna’s 2017 <em>Summer Fine Jewels</em> sale.

In fact, in 2019 the jewelry house released their “<a href=\"https://www.vancleefarpels.com/hk/en/nanosites/treasure-of-rubies.html\">Treasures of Rubies Collection</a>,” which featured 3,000 carats worth of rubies set into 60 unique pieces. This Van Cleef &amp; Arpels “Couscous” Ruby and Diamond Bracelet is no exception to the brand’s dedication in creating only the finest ruby jewelry. Their jewelers choose only the cleanest of stones—a truly difficult task due to the presence of chromium in rubies. While chromium gives rubies their beautiful hue, it also makes them prone to cracks. As a result, very few rubies are able to grow intact into larger sizes and form perfect gemstones. Van Cleef &amp; Arpels selects only the finest natural rubies possible, all of which are unheated and well-cut stones. Crafted in 18K gold, the bombe bracelet of polished gold boules is accented by 156 circular-cut rubies, weighing a total of approximately 8.00 carats—each ruby graced with a remarkable red. The rubies are flanked by three rows of round brilliant cut diamonds, creating a beautiful contrast. This eye-catching accessory had a starting bid of $15,000 at Fortuna’s February <em>Fine Jewels</em> sale in 2018 and ended up achieving $31,250 at auction.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CARTIER FINE BURMESE UNHEATED RUBY AND DIAMOND RING</strong> </h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot-48-ruby-scaled-e1593785275810-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7249\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot-48-ruby-scaled-e1593785275810-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot-48-ruby-scaled-e1593785275810-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot-48-ruby-scaled-e1593785275810-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot-48-ruby-scaled-e1593785275810-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot-48-ruby-scaled-e1593785275810-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Achieved $27,500 at Fortuna’s <em>Magnificent Jewels</em> auction in November 2019.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most famous rubies in the world were set into designs by the French jewelry maison, Cartier.

The ruby is a whopping 2,475 carats and currently resides in Bangalore, India.  This impressive ruby first belonged to the Kings of Vijayanagar, a major South Indian empire between 1300 to 1600 AD, and dedicated this stone to the worship of the god Shiva.  This impressive ruby, is cut as a cabochon, as were many of the King’s smaller rubies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tradition of cutting larger rubies as a cabochon remains today. This Bulgari cabochon unheated Burmese ruby weighs approximately 10.00 carats and is enhanced by stunning round brilliant and baguette-cut diamonds. The Trombino (translated as “little trumpet”) is&nbsp;one of Bulgari’s most time enduring designs. The Italian jewelry brand first introduced the design in the 1930s where it gained instant popularity. The design brought attention to the gemstone at the center and evoked a sense of royalty. It was instantly popular because it allowed the gemstone to stand proud. This Bulgari Burmese Ruby and Diamond “Trombino” Ring evokes that same regal quality as Bulgari’s first designs. This ring is made all the more worthy of nobility with the setting of one of the “king of gems.”<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CARTIER RUBY AND DIAMOND RING</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot51ruby-e1593786254442-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7252\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot51ruby-e1593786254442-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot51ruby-e1593786254442-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot51ruby-e1593786254442-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/lot51ruby-e1593786254442.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Achieved $22,500 at Fortuna’s September 2017 <em>Fine Jewels</em> auction.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One would like to think that Cartier only selected rubies as deep a red as the red leather boxes they are gifted in; and that certainly seems to be the case for this Cartier Ruby and Diamond Ring.

In the modern age, diamond cutting has been perfected with advanced machinery and a rough diamond can be transformed into a faceted stone with optimal brilliance. But how did the master jewelers and <em>diamantaires</em> in the age before mechanized tools accomplish such a feat? Watch the video to appreciate the skill and patience required to create a diamond the traditional way.</p>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Types of Antique Diamonds</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Diamonds that have been cut in the traditional way might not be as brilliant or scatter light with the same vigor as modern diamonds, but they are heavily appreciated for the craftsmanship behind them and the warm, subtle glow they give off. In fact, their market value has steadily increased and continue to be heavily sought after. Here are some of the main traditional diamond cuts used in antique jewelry:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Single Cut:</strong> One of the oldest diamond cuts, the single cut dates back to 1300s. It possesses a large table (or top face), and octagonal girdle (which refers to the defining edge that shapes a diamond). A single cut diamond usually has 18 facets—almost a quarter of the facets seen in the modern round brilliant cut diamonds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rose Cut:</strong> The rose cut dates to the 1500s and was especially common during the&nbsp;Georgian&nbsp;and&nbsp;Victorian&nbsp;eras. It features a flat bottom with a dome-shaped crown, with triangular facets rising to a single apex—thus, resembling the shape of a rose bud. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-GE5VR/an-antique-diamond-brooch\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Victorian-Diamond-Brooch-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7239\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Victorian-Diamond-Brooch-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Victorian-Diamond-Brooch-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Victorian-Diamond-Brooch-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Victorian-Diamond-Brooch-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Victorian-Diamond-Brooch.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>A Victorian brooch featuring a center old European-cut diamond, surrounded by old mine-cut diamonds throughout. <em>(FORTUNA September 2017 Fine Jewels)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Old Mine Cut:</strong> Diamonds with this cut are somewhat similar to today’s cushion-cut. They possess a squarish girdle with gently rounded corners, and have a high crown, a small table, and a large, flat culet (which refers to the pointed bottom of diamonds). The old mine cut dates to the 1700s and was most prevalent during the 1800s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Old European Cut: </strong>This diamond cut is considered a subset of old mine cut diamonds, but are distinguished by a circular girdle, instead of a squared one. Like the old mine cut, it possesses a high crown, small table, and a noticeably flat culet. With 58 facets, it is the precursor of today’s modern round brilliant cut. The Old European cut was heavily used in jewelry of the&nbsp;Victorian,&nbsp;Edwardian, and&nbsp;Art Nouveau&nbsp;eras.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>For more video content, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/FortunaAuction/featured?sub_confirmation=1\">click here to subscribe to FORTUNA’s YouTube channel.</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\t\t","date":"2020-07-02T18:50:40.000Z"},{"id":54,"authorId":5,"categoryId":4,"title":"Bidding Advice for First-Time Bidders","content":"<p><span class=\"drop-caps\">A</span>uctions attract many people looking for the opportunity to own and collect exquisite, designer pieces. If you are a first-time bidder at a jewelry or watch auction, navigating the ins-and-outs might not be super obvious, but it is actually quite simple. There’s a common misconception that auctions are only for a niche group of people, but we here at FORTUNA® are trying to change that notion. The thrill of taking part in an auction should be for everybody and we are happy to share some tips as to how you can get started.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What are the Different Ways to Bid &amp; Their Advantages</span></h2>\n<p>You may be used to seeing auctions in movies and TV where an exclusive group of people, all in their best-kept suits, eagerly battle to be the first to hold up a paddle. At FORTUNA, there are actually multiple ways to bid besides bidding on the floor. Each method comes with its own set of advantages, and we are happy to help find the right way for <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Online bidding</strong> is perfect for beginners who are new to the auction process. You can bid from anywhere in the world on your computer or your mobile device, and can even leave bids before the auction goes live. Leading up to the auction, you will also receive instant notifications if you have been outbid on a lot. We also offer the chance to watch a video live stream and click-in your bids in the moment. The online bidding process is simple, and one of our experts would be happy to walk you through it if you’re not particularly tech-savvy.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone bidding</strong> is recommended for extremely high-value lots. When the stakes are high, you want to make sure you have the specially trained eyes and ears of our phone bidders on the floor to keep you constantly informed. Phone bidders have to be ready to make split-second decisions so we recommend having a good idea of what you’re willing to spend on each lot ahead of time. Many people who bid with us would like to keep anonymous, and phone bidding is the perfect way to bid like you are in the room, with no eyes on you. Another perk of phone bidding is the lack of work on your part; you don’t have to free up your day to make sure you don’t miss your lot, all you have to do is answer the phone.</p>\n<p>An <strong>absentee bid</strong> allows you to leave your highest possible bid ahead of time. The auctioneer will bid on your behalf during the live auction, increment by increment, up until this maximum amount. If nobody bids against you, you will win your lot for the lowest allowed bid. This form of bidding is perfect for those who have a set budget for a particular lot and do not want to overspend. They also take precedence over all other kinds of bids during a live auction, meaning that the auctioneer will honor the absentee bid first, even if an online or phone bid comes in for the same amount. Absentee bids are also ideal for those that find that neither the location nor time of the auction is convenient.</p>\n<p>While in-person bidding is currently suspended due to the global health emergency, we recommend anyone who wants to feel the high-paced thrill of a live auction to view our livestreams on the day of the sale either on Facebook or our website.</p>\n<h2>Are There Specifics to Know Ahead of Time?</h2>\n<p>Typically, new bidders with any auction house will need to submit a valid form of photo ID and credit card information in order to be approved for bidding. The reason for this extra measure is to confirm the bidder’s seriousness in buying at auction, and ensure that all bidders are participating under the fairest conditions. Imagine how frustrating it would be if you realized you were competing against a fraudulent bidder for the same lot! This information usually takes time to process so it is best to do so at least 24 hours before the sale. This, however, is a one-time action. Once you are registered and approved to bid in your first sale, you will be automatically approved to bid in all future sales</p>\n<p>If you have already been pre-approved for a past auction with FORTUNA, registering for an auction is as simple as a click of a button or just showing up on the day of a sale and receiving a paddle. <em>(Floor bidding is currently unavailable due to the statewide response to stunt the spread of COVID-19.)</em></p>\n<p>Leading up to the auction, it is a good idea to decide exactly which lots you intend to bid on, for a number of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you plan on bidding on multiple lots, we advise bidders to calculate in advance how much they plan on spending in total, with buyer’s premium included. For a refresher on our buyer’s premium schedule, <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/buying/\">click here</a>.</li>\n<li>Depending on the value of the lot, the bid increments may vary. If you want to spend no more than your absolute maximum for a particular lot, it is best to familiarize yourself with the <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/conditions-of-sale\">bid increments</a> ahead of the sale—especially since they can range from $100 to $10,000.</li>\n<li>If you don’t intend on watching the sale from start to finish, it’s best to have an idea of the lot numbers you are interested in. The auctioneer typically moves through the sale at a rate of 1 lot per minute, so you can generally mark a reasonable time to check in on the progress of the sale.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to be sure about every detail of an auction house’s process, you can always <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/contact-us/\">contact our office</a> with your questions.</p>\n<h2>Is There A Limit To What You Can Bid On?</h2>\n<p>You can bid on as many items you want during a single auction. If you have online bids exceeding $50,000, it is likely our office might ask you to provide a bank reference prior to the sale.</p>\n<p>Experienced bidders will tell you that it is important to set an overall budget for yourself so you don’t spend more than anticipated. Keep track of what you have bid on already, so you do not accidentally bid more on additional items—especially if you are reaching your limit for the auction.</p>\n<p>Remember to also take into account additional costs, aside from the buyer’s premium—such as local taxes if applicable, and online fees for bidding platforms other than FORTUNA’S app or website.</p>\n<h2>Should You Research Prior to the Auction?</h2>\n<p>Absolutely! You should always learn about the jewelry on sale to make the most informed bids at an auction since all merchandise is sold as-is. Read about an item’s details in the online catalog, visit the showroom during exhibition dates or schedule an appointment to preview. Also, make sure to keep an eye out for our social media and blog posts, which always give a closer look at our jewelry and watch lots. If you can’t come to view your desired lot in person, you can always email <a href=\"mailto:condition@fortunaauction.com\">condition@fortunaauction.com</a> to request more information or photographs. Our specialists want you to bid confidently and encourage all questions about our offered lots.</p>\n<h2>Sign up to Bid at an Upcoming FORTUNA®</h2>\n<p>If you’re planning to bid on a sale, take the first step and <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/auctions/\">evaluate the selection of future auctions</a>.

Billie, born Eleanora Fagan, had all the odds stacked against her since childhood. Born as the illegitimate child of two African American teens in Philadelphia in 1915, Billie would fight off every adversity imaginable. Her father left her and her mother when she was very young to pursue a career in jazz, so she was left to be raised by her mother and grandmother. Billie was moved to Harlem, New York at just 14 where her mother worked in a brothel, and Billie suffered as a victim of sex trafficking. Both she and her mother were subsequently sent to prison. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-7359\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"981\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1024px-Billie_Holiday_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_William_P._Gottlieb_04251-981x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7375\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1024px-Billie_Holiday_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_William_P._Gottlieb_04251-981x1024.jpg 981w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1024px-Billie_Holiday_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_William_P._Gottlieb_04251-287x300.jpg 287w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1024px-Billie_Holiday_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_William_P._Gottlieb_04251-768x802.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/1024px-Billie_Holiday_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_William_P._Gottlieb_04251.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px\"><figcaption><em>&nbsp;Billie Holiday at Downbeat, NY (1947).

Gottlieb&nbsp;collection at the&nbsp;Library of Congress</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon her release, Billie began singing in Harlem nightclubs under the pseudonym Billie Holiday, taking her name from the actress Billie Dove, and Clarence Holiday, her presumed father. Billie’s life was enshrouded by a cloud of mystery and even today, long after her death, much is wondered about the acclaimed singer. Just as we have never been able to confirm her paternity, we cannot confirm some of her closest relations. Her watch seems to be gifted by a benefactor or patron to her career, and although it is engraved with “<em>To Billie From David 1938</em>,” nothing is known of her relationship with this David. But what is clear is that he knew Billie at a pivotal time in the singer’s life. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&nbsp;“Lady Day is unquestionably the most important influence on American popular singing in the last 20 years.”</p><cite>Frank Sinatra</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one year later, Billie recorded the song “<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/Web007rzSOI\" target=\"_blank\">Strange Fruit</a>,” one of the most moving and haunting songs of our time. Originally a poem about the horrors of lynchings in the American South, the song was brought to life with Billie’s emotive voice. Billie debuted the song at the historic, Café Society, the first truly integrated nightclub in the country, where black and white guests were treated equally, no matter who the performer. And it was quite possibly the only popular venue in America in which the song could be performed and sympathized with. As the song became a feature of Billie’s performances nationwide, it placed Billie and its creators in the crosshairs of the Federal Government. And despite being banned from multiple radio stations and even refused by Holiday’s label, Columbia Records, Billie Holiday’s delivery of “Strange Fruit” captured the American people and forced them to confront the reality of racism against Black folks. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Holiday doesn’t sing songs; she transforms them.”</p><cite>William Dufty, co-author of <em>Lady Sings the Blues</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The song remains as prevalent as ever today, being played at Black Lives Matter protests around the country and being sampled on a Kanye West’s track, “Blood on the Leaves.” Three-time Grammy-nominated artist, Betty LaVette released a cover of the song last month citing the current focus on racial tensions. And just last week, Paramount won the rights to the film “The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” what promises to be a blockbuster biopic on the singer’s life. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"920\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2048px-Portrait_of_Billie_Holiday_and_Mister_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_LOC_5020400274-920x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7386\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2048px-Portrait_of_Billie_Holiday_and_Mister_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_LOC_5020400274-920x1024.jpg 920w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2048px-Portrait_of_Billie_Holiday_and_Mister_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_LOC_5020400274-270x300.jpg 270w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2048px-Portrait_of_Billie_Holiday_and_Mister_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_LOC_5020400274-768x855.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2048px-Portrait_of_Billie_Holiday_and_Mister_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_LOC_5020400274-1380x1536.jpg 1380w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2048px-Portrait_of_Billie_Holiday_and_Mister_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_LOC_5020400274-1840x2048.jpg 1840w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2048px-Portrait_of_Billie_Holiday_and_Mister_Downbeat_New_York_N.Y._ca._Feb._1947_LOC_5020400274.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px\"><figcaption><em>Portrait of Billie, wearing her iconic gardenias and posing with her dog, Mister.

Gottlieb&nbsp;collection at the&nbsp;Library of Congress.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At first sight, this watch may be simply a beautiful piece of jewelry, masterfully crafted. Yet, it symbolizes so much more. Billie wore this watch at the height of her career and during America’s Jim Crow era. It was no easy feat for an African American woman born into poverty at the beginning of the twentieth century to find herself wearing a diamond watch as an adult. But unfortunately, the glamour and riches that Billie enjoyed as a singer was fleeting. While on stage, Billie was doused in diamonds, yet she died with mere pennies in her bank account—highlighting the discrepancies in fortune available to African American women in show business at the time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Holiday left more behind than her meager estate; she left a legacy of talent and gumption that few singers that followed could match. Her accomplishments were not just made in spite of racial biases but by fighting them head-on. Billie was just as vocal about racial injustices off the stage as she was on, denouncing the death of her father to unequal treatment received in a hospital and the hypocrisy of being invited to sing in white nightclubs but never to dine in them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Billie Holiday’s heart-rending voice in “Strange Fruit” has became the battle cry for racial equality and its impact has reverberated in the decades following. For her admirers who cherish not only what Billie Holiday has done for music and jazz, but also her stand against racial inequality, her diamond watch will be a true treasure, commemorating an era of American history—tarnished by civil injustices and full of boundaries being freshly broken. </p>\n\t\t","date":"2020-07-09T16:31:43.000Z"},{"id":56,"authorId":9,"categoryId":4,"title":"The History of the Hope Diamond","content":"\n<p>Diamonds are one of the most prominent physical representations of wealth and value you can find.

At some point after its discovery, it passed into the hands of a traveling French merchant named Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who brought it with him back to Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"416\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02-Where-did-it-originate-1-1024x416.jpg\" alt=\"Where-did-it-originate\" class=\"wp-image-7526\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02-Where-did-it-originate-1-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02-Where-did-it-originate-1-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02-Where-did-it-originate-1-768x312.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/02-Where-did-it-originate-1.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who Owned It?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most fascinating element of the diamond’s history comes down to the number of remarkable historical figures who have owned it. Beginning the day Tavernier sold it, the Hope Diamond made a name for itself in large part due simply to the fame and fortune of those figures, and the way it changed hands between them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Royal Heirloom</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first figure to acquire the diamond, purchasing it from Tavernier in 1668, was King Louis XIV of France. As an unbelievably wealthy and extravagant ruler, Louis had the diamond recut and made into one of his crown jewels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon Louis’s death, the diamond passed to his son and grandson, finally settling on Louis XVI. This Louis, along with his wife, Marie Antoinette, were beheaded during the French Revolution. The subsequent looting of the royal treasuries caused the diamond to be lost for several years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it resurfaced again in 1812, it was in the hands of a diamond merchant in London named Daniel Eliason, who eventually sold it to yet another king — this time, King George IV of the United Kingdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Family Name</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Upon George’s death, the diamond was most likely sold to pay off debt incurred during his reign, and by 1839 it had made its way to well-known collector Henry Philip Hope, from whom it got its name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Hope’s death, the diamond passed to his nephew, Henry Thomas, and then to Henry Thomas’s grandson, Lord Francis Hope. When Lord Francis eventually sold it in 1901 to pay off his debts, it went through a series of jewel merchants. Lord Francis sold it to a local dealer in London, who sold it to Joseph Frankels in New York City, who sold it to Selim Habib, who sold it to C.H. Rosenau.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Social Symbol</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosenau finally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesdigitalcovers/2019/12/06/secret-history-hope-diamond-the-cartiers-book-excerpt/#37ade6117bed\">sold the gem to Pierre Cartier</a>, the acclaimed jeweler in Paris. Cartier had little interest in passing the diamond to another merchant, instead, turning his eye to the supply of wealthy American socialites. He found his ideal target in Evalyn Walsh McLean, the heiress to a multimillionaire who literally struck gold working as a miner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McLean was fascinated with diamonds and other gems, so Cartier made every effort to sell her the Hope Diamond. After a few failed attempts, he succeeded in persuading her by leaving the diamond in her hands for a week, long enough for her to become attached to it. Then, following a frustratingly long process, McLean finally purchased the diamond in 1911 and maintained ownership of it for the rest of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"416\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/03-Why-is-it-so-special-1024x416.jpg\" alt=\"Why-is-it-so-special\" class=\"wp-image-7525\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/03-Why-is-it-so-special-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/03-Why-is-it-so-special-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/03-Why-is-it-so-special-768x312.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/03-Why-is-it-so-special.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When McLean died in 1949, wealthy American jeweler Harry Winston purchased the diamond. After spending just under a decade putting the diamond on display around the country, he generously donated the stone to the Smithsonian Institute in 1958.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Is It So Special?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the Hope Diamond’s value stems from its remarkable history, and from all the impressive figures who have possessed it over the centuries. But its history isn’t the only quality that makes it valuable — after all, it had no history at all when it was sold to Louis XIV, and yet surely it must have had great value to attract the interest of a man styling himself “the Sun King.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most visible source of the diamond’s value is its sheer beauty. Covered in countless facets, it holds a deep blue color all the way through—due to trace elements of boron in the stone. It is also classified as a Type IIb diamond, the rarest of natural diamonds which possess incredibly low levels of nitrogen impurities and phosphoresces, emitting a red glow when exposed to ultraviolet light.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natural blue diamonds are incredibly rare to begin with, and most of them are neither as bold or as large as the Hope Diamond. At&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.si.edu/spotlight/hope-diamond\">45.52 carats</a>, it’s the largest blue diamond known to exist, and that’s after undergoing numerous recuts. In its original form, it was recorded as being 112 carats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the diamond carries an element of intrigue due to the misfortune it’s been historically rumored to bring. Much like with Tutankhamen’s tomb, many of the people associated with it have suffered from a run of bad luck, from Louis XVI’s execution to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://naturalhistory2.si.edu/mineralsciences/hope/details/the-misfortunes-of-evalyn-walsh-mclean.htm\">deaths of Evalyn McLean’s children</a>. Even figures like McLean herself were attracted to the diamond due in part to this intrigue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where Is It Today?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hope Diamond has been in the possession of the Smithsonian Institute since it was gifted by Harry Winston. It’s kept on display in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., at the forefront of the gem collection. Locked safely in a display case, it’s kept rotating slowly on its pedestal for visitors to look at and admire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sell or Buy Other Treasures at an Upcoming Auction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Hope Diamond may be safely stored in the Smithsonian, but it’s a long way from being the only item of significant value in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to invest in your next natural diamond wonder, <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/auctions/\">the auction specialists</a> at FORTUNA® can help you find the perfect piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start the process, just&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/contact-us/\">get in touch with us</a>&nbsp;today!</p>\n\t\t","date":"2020-08-03T14:27:41.000Z"},{"id":57,"authorId":3,"categoryId":4,"title":"Ulysse Nardin Anchor Tourbillon Limited Carbon Dial in 18K White Gold.","content":"\n<p>FORTUNA is excited to bring to auction a rare timepiece and marvel of horological innovation: the <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-3VYO4G/ulysse-nardin-anchor-tourbillon-limited-carbon-dial-in-18k-white-gold\">Ulysse Nardin Anchor Tourbillon Limited Carbon Dial in 18K White Gold</a>.

Made by dedicated watchmakers and nanofabrication engineers alike, the Anchor escapement consists mostly of silicon parts, an unconventional material in the world of luxury watch making, but its resistance to magnetism and ability to be manufactured to a level of accuracy only possible with nanotechnology makes it the ideal material for horologists. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-7587\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Ulysse Nardin pioneered the use of silicon technology in the escapement of its mechanical watches, drastically improving the regulation system of how a mechanical watch transfers energy in equal doses from the mainspring barrel onto the balance wheel. Silicon is extremely durable, yet surprisingly lightweight, and its replacement of metal and jeweled parts in the escapement creates a very low friction environment, resulting in better precision and time keeping accuracy of the watch. Unlike standard metal movements, silicon parts also do not require lubrication or constant maintenance. Furthermore, one of the biggest advantages of silicon is how technology can be utilized to manufacture pieces to extreme precision. The Anchor escapement incorporates silicon blades with the thickness of 15 micrometers, roughly one-tenth the thickness of a human hair, owed entirely to the silicon micro-machining technology of DRIE (Deep Reactive Ion Etching). After 7 years of research and development by Ulysse Nardin in achieving this new anchor escapement, you can rest assured that you are investing in a watch meant to last lifetimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/watch-2-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7699\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/watch-2-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/watch-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/watch-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/watch-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/watch-2-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/watch-2-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ulysse-Nardin-Anchor-Tourbillon-Box-and-Papers-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7721\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ulysse-Nardin-Anchor-Tourbillon-Box-and-Papers-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ulysse-Nardin-Anchor-Tourbillon-Box-and-Papers-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ulysse-Nardin-Anchor-Tourbillon-Box-and-Papers-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ulysse-Nardin-Anchor-Tourbillon-Box-and-Papers-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ulysse-Nardin-Anchor-Tourbillon-Box-and-Papers-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ulysse-Nardin-Anchor-Tourbillon-Box-and-Papers-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally debuted in 2015, there are only eight versions of the Ulysse Nardin Anchor Tourbillon, featuring a variety of dials and case metals.

For our <em><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-394JAR/august-jewels-watches\">August Jewels &amp; Watches</a></em> auction, we are excited to present multiple iconic pieces by Bulgari, the renowned luxury Italian jeweler. To commemorate the long history and successes of the brand, we decided to dive deep into its past and highlight some of their more celebrated designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulgari was founded in Rome in 1884 by the talented Greek silversmith Sotirios Georgis Boulgaris; his name was later Italianised to Sotirio Bulgari.&nbsp;In its early years, Bulgari was known for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver\">silver</a>&nbsp;pieces that borrowed elements from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire\">Byzantine</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_art\">Islamic art</a>, combining them with floral motifs. Having latched onto jewelry style trends emanating from Paris, Bulgari continued to follow the lead of what was then the world’s jewelry capital throughout the first half of the century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Sotirio passed away in 1932, his two sons,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Bulgari\">Giorgio</a>&nbsp;and Costantino—who each had a keen interest in precious stones and jewels—took over the business. The brothers undertook an extravagant remodeling of both the interior and the exterior of the Via Condotti store and formally changed the company logo to “BVLGARI,” an application of the traditional Roman alphabet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-3AJZEU/bulgari-serpenti-tubogas-in-18k-rose-gold\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bulgari-watch-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"bvgari serpenti tubogas in 18K rose gold\" class=\"wp-image-7695\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bulgari-watch-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bulgari-watch-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bulgari-watch-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bulgari-watch-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bulgari-watch-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/bulgari-watch-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption><em>Bvlgari Serpenti Tubogas in 18K Rose Gold. Achieved $13,750 at auction.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the 1940s came to a close, Bulgari introduced the <em>Serpenti</em> bracelet-watches, which were constructed using a technique called <em>Tubogas</em>. <em>Tubogas</em> literally translates to “gas pipe,” and is the descriptive name given to a type of chain formed from a pair of interlocking long gold strips wrapped tightly together. The core is then removed, making the now hollow piece remarkably flexible and lightweight. The edges interlock, requiring no soldering. While Bulgari’s first example was made in 1948, it took another 15 years before its goldsmiths fully mastered the technique, and made it one of the brand’s iconic designs. Even without the recognizable <em>Tubogas</em> look, the Italian jeweler has often incorporated flexible bands in many of their works, such as these <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-394JAR/august-jewels-watches?limit=36&amp;search=vintage+bulgari\">vintage Bulgari accessories</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enamored by ancient legends of the snake, a symbol of rebirth and vitality, Bulgari has reimagined its famous serpent in countless designs. Pictured below, <em>LVCEA</em>’s gleaming band also takes inspiration from <em>Serpenti</em>, with each interlocking element mimicking a reptilian scale.

The modular <em>Parentesi</em> designs were widely inspired by the ancient city of Rome, where Bulgari is headquartered. The details found in Roman pavements and the travertine junctions used to link the stone blocks all incorporate the parenthesis-like shape from which the collection gets its name. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulgari has derived inspiration from the Eternal City in more than one fashion. The cupolas of the Roman landscape were able to grace their way onto women’s fingers in the form of bold colored gemstones with a smooth, domed cut—known as “cabochon.” Perhaps the most famous use of the cabochon by Bulgari is the <em>Trombino</em> ring—famously worn by Elizabeth Taylor. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2054-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"bulgari pink tourmaline and diamond ring\" class=\"wp-image-7758\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2054-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2054-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2054-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2054-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2054-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2054-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption><em>Bulgari Pink Tourmaline and Diamond Ring.

Bulgari has since come out with more rings that resemble the imposing design of the <em>Trombino</em>. The Bulgari Pink Tourmaline and Diamond Ring, pictured above, is set with a large cabochon pink tourmaline, standing proudly above round brilliant cut diamonds. The use of stones for their impact, rather than the intrinsic value of the gem, was a huge departure from the classical Parisian design that dominated the time and distinguished Bulgari as an inimitable creator in the jewelry industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulgari has never been afraid to make bold statements with their designs and they have faithfully brought back past designs in fresh ways. The brand has not only maintained relevance but continues to lead the jewelry industry, no less than 130 years since its inception. </p>\n\t\t","date":"2020-08-19T21:39:04.000Z"},{"id":59,"authorId":5,"categoryId":3,"title":"Patek Philippe: Luxury Watch Manufacturer","content":"\n<p>Many of today’s luxury watch brands were founded hundreds of years ago by master watchmakers.

The rise of the vintage watch market combined with the storied, centuries-long brand of Patek Philippe has done wonders for the secondary market value of iconic Patek Philippe watches. Before selling your Patek timepiece, having a seasoned watch specialist inspect the watch first can make all the difference. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>FORTUNA has years of experience selling highly sought after Patek watches and is especially attuned to details that can affect value. Our watch specialists recognized this <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-1A0I28/patek-philippe-ref-2526-in-18k-gold-with-bracelet\">Patek Philippe Ref. 2526</a>, pictured below, as being part of the first series of the reference—contributing immensely to its market value. Furthermore, the reference 2526 is widely considered to be Patek Philippe’s first automatic watch ever made, making it even more desirable to collectors. With the information uncovered by our specialists, this precious heirloom watch achieved $50,000 at FORTUNA®’s September 2018 Important Watches auction. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-1A0I28/patek-philippe-ref-2526-in-18k-gold-with-bracelet\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lot-59-e1599249889181-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"patek philippe ref. 2526b in 18K gold with bracelet\" class=\"wp-image-7890\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lot-59-e1599249889181-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lot-59-e1599249889181-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lot-59-e1599249889181-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lot-59-e1599249889181-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/lot-59-e1599249889181-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Patek Philippe Ref. 2526 in 18K Gold With Bracelet </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started selling your prized watches, fill out an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/valuation/\">online form</a>&nbsp;or contact FORTUNA at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:valuation@fortunaauction.com\">valuation@fortunaauction.com</a>&nbsp;with details and images of the item for a free, no-obligation valuation.

Rubies have always been held in high esteem in ancient Asian cultures, and with the emergence of Western culture, the gemstone was often associated with medieval European royalty as a symbol of their wealth.

For many hundreds of years, Burma — now known as Myanmar — was where most of the world’s rubies were found. Today, rubies from this region are rarer, but the gemstones are still mined in the area as well as in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Some rubies have even been found in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burmese rubies are among the finest and rarest stones in the world. Prized for their deep red color, the importation of the stone was actually banned in the US until 2017 to put pressure on the Myanmar government. The ban was lifted in 2017 and so the demand for beautiful jewels such as this <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-3N9RC5/very-fine-burmese-ruby-and-diamond-bracelet\">Very Fine Burmese Ruby and Diamond Bracelet</a> from FORTUNA’s upcoming <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-3LGHIO/november-jewels-watches\">November Jewels &amp; Watches sale</a>, has been revived. The beautiful accessory has a cumulative Burmese ruby carat weight of 18.30 carats and is being offered Thursday, November 5th, for a starting bid of $20,000.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What Color Ruby Is Most Valuable?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The red color of rubies is caused by the presence of chromium in the gemstone, and it is the characteristic that affects the gemstone’s value the most.&nbsp;A ruby’s red shade can range from a vibrant red to deep red, and even orangey to purplish red. Rubies with the purest red color and no treatments command higher prices, while the most desirable rubies are those that exhibit a very deep red and slight purple tinge. This color is known in the industry as “pigeon’s blood” and is exceptionally rare and sought by collector’s worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bulgari-Trombino-Ruby-Diamond-Ring-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2684\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bulgari-Trombino-Ruby-Diamond-Ring-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bulgari-Trombino-Ruby-Diamond-Ring-366x244.jpg 366w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bulgari-Trombino-Ruby-Diamond-Ring-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bulgari-Trombino-Ruby-Diamond-Ring-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bulgari-Trombino-Ruby-Diamond-Ring.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What Are the Quality Factors in a Ruby?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While a ruby’s color might be the primary factor a collector considers when contemplating value, there are multiple characteristics to be aware of before investing in ruby gemstones: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Color:</strong>&nbsp;A natural, untreated, and deep color is most prized. Rubies that are too light or dark or have orange undertones do not command the same high prices, but they do have enthusiasts.</li><li><strong>Size:&nbsp;</strong>Larger gemstone-quality rubies are higher in value than their smaller counterparts. Natural, untreated gemstone-quality rubies over 1 carat are already quite hard to come by, and can command high prices.</li><li><strong>Inclusions:&nbsp;</strong>Any inclusions that affect the brightness of the ruby or are visible can significantly reduce value. While almost all rubies have some inclusions, fewer inclusions and less-visible ones improve value.</li><li><strong>Asterism:&nbsp;</strong>Some rubies have a “star effect,” which can create a unique look and even soften the color. Depending on the cut and appearance, this can increase or decrease value.</li><li><strong>Fluorescence:</strong>&nbsp;Rubies fluoresce and seem to “glow” in some light. This fluorescence can affect the way the ruby appears in daylight, and in turn, its market value. </li><li><strong>Custom cut and recut:</strong>&nbsp;Rubies that have been commercially cut or native cut in the country where they were mined are worth less than recut or custom-cut gemstones sent to experienced cutters. In general, cuts that highlight the beauty of the ruby, minimize any inclusions and maintain as much size as possible are the most valued.</li><li><strong>Origin:</strong>&nbsp;Burmese rubies are considered the most valuable. A small percentage of them are known to possess a deep, almost purple color known as “pigeon’s blood red” and have significant fluorescence, making them appear to glow even in daylight. Mogok and Sri Lankan rubies are also highly valued.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Selling and Buying Rubies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you want to sell an heirloom ruby ring or purchase some fine pieces for your collection, FORTUNA can help.

Passed down through the centuries, these jewels have left a trail of destruction and death in their wake, leading many to believe they are cursed. Explore the storied pasts of the five gems known as the most beautiful and dangerous jewels in history.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-8279\"></span></p>\n<h2>1. The Hope Diamond</h2>\n<p>The infamous 45.52-carat Hope Diamond has been linked to tragic tales that span monarchies around the globe.&nbsp;Many who possess it have died unexpectedly, suffering fates like stabbings, beheadings, murder and suicide.</p>\n<p><img class=\"img-frame \" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hope.png\"></p>\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/the-history-of-the-hope-diamond/\">history of the Hope Diamond</a>&nbsp;begins in an Indian mine, where it was first discovered in the 17th century. It soon found its way to the crown of King Louis XIV of France. After being passed through generations of French royalty, the Hope Diamond was owned by Louis XVI when he and his wife, Marie Antoinette, met a gruesome demise during the French Revolution.</p>\n<p>The Hope Diamond went on to travel through a long line of merchants and elites, including Evalyn Walsh McLean. This socialite did not originally believe in superstition — but the unexpected deaths of her son and daughter, followed by her husband’s admission to a mental hospital, convinced her of the diamond’s curse.</p>\n<p>McLean sold the jewel, which eventually made its way to its current resting place at the Smithsonian Institution at an estimated value of a quarter of a billion dollars.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h2>2. The Delhi Sapphire</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cursed Delhi Sapphire is famed to bring terrible misfortune, financial ruin and poor health to anyone who possesses it. The fable of this beautiful gem, which is actually an amethyst, originated when a British soldier stole the stone from the temple of Indra in the 1850s. After experiencing repeated bad luck, the soldier gifted it to a scientist, who experienced a similar fate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following two unsuccessful attempts to give the stone away, the scientist threw the Delhi Sapphire into a London canal. However, this didn’t free him of its curse. The amethyst was dredged and returned to him, at which point he stored it under strict instructions that it be locked away until his death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Delhi Sapphire was discovered in storage and is now displayed at the London Natural History Museum.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. The Black Orlov</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 1099px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"img-frame \" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_1.png\" alt=\"black orlov diamond\" width=\"1089\" height=\"721\"><p class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Vicky Patterson who works at the Natural History Museum in Central London, wears the Black Orlov Diamond, which is said to be cursed, at a Museum photocall this morning. (Photo by John Stillwell – PA Images/PA Images via Getty Images)</em></p></div>\n<p>The Black Orlov — also known as the Eye of Brahma Diamond — is an exquisite 67.50-carat black diamond. Rumored to have been stolen from an ancient statue of the Hindu god Brahma, legend says this theft invoked an unshakeable curse on anyone who carries the diamond.</p>\n<p>After bringing the Black Orlov to New York City in 1932, the thief, a diamond dealer, died by suicide. Two of the diamond’s future owners — a pair of Russian princesses — also killed themselves in a similar manner within months of possessing the diamond. Today, the Black Orlov is featured as the center stone of a diamond pendant.</p>\n\n\n<h2>4. The Regent Diamond</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After being stolen from an Indian mine by a slave in the late 1600s, the 140.64-carat Regent Diamond was smuggled on board a ship to Europe. Upon hearing of the valuable gemstone, the ship’s captain murdered the slave, stole the diamond and sold it to an Indian merchant. It eventually made its way to decorate the sword hilt of Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its popularity among famed French leaders, the Regent Diamond has been connected to a long streak of violence and murder. Many of the monarchs who possessed it — including Louis XVI, Louis VII and Charles X — lost their thrones through execution, exile or abdication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, you can view the Regent Diamond on display at the Louvre.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. The Koh-i-Noor Diamond</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kohinoor-1-1024x499.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8284\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kohinoor-1-1024x499.png 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kohinoor-1-300x146.png 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kohinoor-1-768x374.png 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kohinoor-1.png 1079w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption><em>The Crystal Palace and its contents</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kohinoor.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wikimedia Commons</a>&nbsp;// Public Domain<br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The folklore surrounding the Koh-i-Noor Diamond stems back to 18th century India, where the uncut diamond decorated the empire’s golden throne. The stone is rumored to have been worth more than the Taj Mahal, which was under construction at the time. The English took the stone during the colonization of India, gifting it to Queen Victoria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From cholera outbreaks to fearsome storms and unfortunate accidents, the gemstone has been linked to misfortune since its first voyage from India to England.&nbsp;According to legend, the Koh-i-Noor Diamond only brings bad luck to men, with every male possessor historically losing his throne. The English royal women, free of its curse, have claimed the gemstone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, you can see the stunning oval diamond on display in the Tower of London as part of the Crown Jewels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Interested in Learning More?

In fact, the finest diamonds were historically referred to as “gems of the first water”—such that the purest diamonds mimicked the color of the clearest drop of water. This age-old comparison was even noted as early as 1607, in Shakespeare’s <em>Pericles:</em></p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>Heavenly jewels which Pericles hath lost,</p><p>Begin to part their fringes of bright gold.</p><p>The diamonds of a most praisèd water</p><p>Doth appear, to make the world twice rich.</p><p></p><cite>Shakespeare, Pericles (Act III, Scene 2)</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, diamonds are graded on internationally recognized scales for both clarity and color. The majority of diamonds possess varying levels of nitrogen in their chemical composition, which give them a slight yellow tinge. Colorless diamonds that possess very low levels of nitrogen are exceptionally rare and command extremely high prices at market—with prices per carat consistently increasing over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-8303\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>Type IIa diamonds refer to diamonds that have no measurable levels of nitrogen impurities, even rarer than the standard “colorless” diamonds.

Long before the cultivation of pearls was discovered, a natural pearl necklace comprised of well-matched spheres was a treasure of almost incomparable value, reserved almost exclusively for the noble, rich, and powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike gemstones that are mined from the earth, a living organism actually produces a pearl. A pearl is formed when an irritant, such as parasite, sand or a piece of shell, becomes accidentally lodged in an oyster’s soft inner cavity—similar to our own unfortunate experiences with splinters. As a natural physiological response, oysters coat that irritant to protect itself with a crystalline fluid composed of calcium carbonate called “nacre.” Over time, nacre builds up around the irritant in layers until a pearl is formed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are Non-Nacreous Pearls?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The term “pearl” generally refers to nacreous creations found in oysters, but there are also non-nacreous gems created in other mollusks that fall under this category. These include incredibly rare, oval-shaped conch pearls and yellowish-orange Melo pearls. In this article, we will be elaborating on the non-nacreous Melo pearl, which is formed in a similar fashion as the oyster pearl, but are composed of mainly calcite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melo pearls come from the <em>Melo melo</em> gastropod from the Volutidae family, also known as the Indian volute or the bailer shell. This large sea snail has a limited range, occupying shallow seas and populates the South China Sea. They can also be found near Myanmar, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Melo pearls are non-nacreous, they do not have the familiar&nbsp;iridescent&nbsp;shine of&nbsp;white pearls. However, the Melo pearl has a porcelaneous luster that makes it very attractive. Occurring in a range of colors, the most prized is the intense orange hue similar to a ripe papaya. These pearls exhibit silky flame-like stripes, and the most valuable Melo pearls are those with excellent flame structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LOT-H1001-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8510\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LOT-H1001-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LOT-H1001-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LOT-H1001-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LOT-H1001-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LOT-H1001-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/LOT-H1001-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\"></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/H1001-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8415\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/H1001-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/H1001-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/H1001-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/H1001-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/H1001-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/H1001-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>A 39.91ct <em>Melo melo</em> pearl lariat necklace (Lot 3002, December Jewels &amp; Watches)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/H1001-hero-10-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8509\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/H1001-hero-10-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/H1001-hero-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/H1001-hero-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/H1001-hero-10-400x267.jpg 400w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/H1001-hero-10.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>These rare pearls were once a sign of royalty in Eastern cultures, even when they were unknown to the rest of the world. Believed to be droplets falling from dragons in the sky, Melo pearls were worshipped as holy objects. Because of this, they were never drilled and worn. Still, emperors would often wear motifs of a dragon chasing a flaming orange pearl.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Rare are Melo Pearls?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The probability of finding an orange Melo pearl is one in several thousand shells, and they occur in a variety of shapes, ranging from irregular baroque to oval and egg-shaped. Although generally rounded, nearly perfect spheres are extremely rare and especially coveted. While most pearls are measured in millimeters according to their size, Melo pearls, like diamonds, are measured in carats. They are also harder than traditional pearls at 5 Mohs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oysters and mussels can be cultured or farmed to create pearls, however, the Melo pearl has not yet been successfully cultured. This means that every Melo pearl found is natural, grown in the wild through the creature’s own devices—making Melo pearls all the more desirable and rare.</p>\n\t\t","date":"2020-12-03T22:32:07.000Z"},{"id":65,"authorId":2,"categoryId":2,"title":"FORTUNA® Ends the Year Strong with Important Estate Diamonds","content":"<p>FORTUNA’s most-anticipated sale of the year, the <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-3RYBG8/december-jewels-watches-all-sold-values-include-hammer-plus-buyers-premium?limit=36\"><em>December Jewels &amp; Watches</em></a> auction, came to an exciting close on Thursday, December 10, 2020 after nearly a full day of live bidding activity.

Despite being one of the later consigned items of FORTUNA’s over 400-lot catalog, the impressive <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-3VYO4M/rolex-6241-daytona-in-14k-gold\">Rolex Daytona Ref. 6241 in 14K Gold</a> got the bidding attention it deserved. Amassing one of the world’s largest followings in vintage sports watches, the Rolex Daytona is a tour de force of mechanical timepieces. Debuting in 1966, the Ref. 6241 is especially rare for its 14K gold case—only seeing about 3000 examples made in all metals. Opening at auction with a starting bid of $70,000, the price quickly climbed between multiple phone bidders. After a tense final exchange between two phone bidders, the classic timepiece eventually went for a hammer price of $135,000 and a final achieved price of $168,750.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-8568\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3006-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8563\" width=\"264\" height=\"264\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3006-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3006-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3006-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3006-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3006-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3006-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\"><figcaption>13.61-Carat Fancy Yellow Diamond Ring (Lot 3006, <em>December Jewels &amp; Watches</em>)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Other overachieving lots, unsurprisingly, were diamond jewels coming from a series of important estates.

Jewelry is a study of science, art, history—<em>everything</em>. One of the first places people turn to when learning about the evolution of jewelry is the monarchies of the world.

The British Royal Family has one of the most extensive jewelry collections in the world. Much of the collection we’ve seen today were acquired during Queen Mary’s reign. One of the most iconic pieces of jewelry from her collection was the Fringe Tiara. Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Anne both wore The Queen Mary Fringe Tiara on their wedding days, and Her Majesty most recently loaned the piece to her granddaughter, Princess Beatrice of York, for her socially-distanced wedding to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2020. The diamonds of this tiara, however, go back much farther than that; they were originally part of a necklace that Queen Victoria had made and given to Mary as a wedding gift in 1893.  The avid jewelry collector, Queen Mary, had the necklace taken apart and made into the Fringe Tiara, to resemble those made popular by the imperial court of the Romanovs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crown-jewels.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9136\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crown-jewels.jpg 600w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/crown-jewels-300x152.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"><figcaption>Russian Crown Jewels on display after the Bolsheviks established the Soviet Union (via <em>www.usgs.gov</em>)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The quick and violent fall of the Romanov family in Russia saw a huge dispersion of the empire’s greatest jewels and treasures. Historians are still attempting to track down what happened to most of them, which were largely looted. Among the treasures that remain in the country is the Imperial Crown of Russia, a crown thought to be so valuable that its replica alone, which travels the globe as a part of museum exhibitions, is worth $15.1 million in material value. One particularly striking pearl drop tiara known as “the Russian Beauty” found its way into many great hands after the fall of the Russian empire. It went from Empress of Russia Marie Feodorovna, to the 9th Duke of Marlborough, to the First Lady of the Philippines, to eventually fall into the hands of the Philippine authorities when the presidential family fled to Hawaii. It is much hoped that the tiara remains in the possession of the current Filipino government and that it will one day make its way back to the public eye. Another item from the collection of Marie Feodorovna may have&nbsp;wound up&nbsp;in the possession of the British royal family. A diamond and pearl choker with a geometric sapphire and diamond was allegedly purchased by Queen Mary and has been seen on Queen Elizabeth II’s daughter, Princess Anne, on occasions such as the gala on the eve of Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-12-at-12.25.05-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9140\" width=\"394\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-12-at-12.25.05-PM.png 394w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-12-at-12.25.05-PM-212x300.png 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\"><figcaption>Princess Anne of England in what is believed to be the missing Romanov Choker</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/isa.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9134\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/isa.jpg 800w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/isa-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/isa-768x456.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"><figcaption>Queen Isabella pledging her jewels for Columbus’ expedition in the 15th century, in a painting by artist Antonio Munoz Degrain (1843-1924), c. 1878 (via Stock Photo).</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There is much myth and lore surrounding jewelry, none perhaps as consequential as that of the discovery of the New World.

In reality, much of Queen Isabella’s jewelry remains in Spain today, and much more was created upon the discovery of gold, silver, and valuable spices in South America.&nbsp; The Spanish acquired great wealth as a result of the settlement of the New World, wealth whose remnants can still be seen today in the collection of jewelry amassed by the Spanish royal family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"595\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-12-at-12.11.43-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9137\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-12-at-12.11.43-PM.png 595w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-12-at-12.11.43-PM-300x230.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\"><figcaption>Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden wears the Napoleonic Amethyst Parure Tiara in Amsterdam in April 2013 (via Michel Porro/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Amethysts were valued higher than diamonds for both their color and their rarity.

Jean Schlumberger was deeply inspired by nature and movement, which is apparent in this <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-4CAKF6/tiffany-co-schlumberger-vintage-multi-gemstone-fish-brooch\">Tiffany &amp; Co.

The jeweler traveled far and wide seeking inspiration from places like Bali, India, and Thailand. The “Bird on a Rock” is one of the famed French designer’s most iconic pieces, originally designed in 1956 with the&nbsp;Tiffany Yellow Diamond&nbsp;in mind, one of the largest yellow diamonds to have ever been discovered. Since then, the design has been reissued by Tiffany &amp; Co.—still with only large stones as the bird’s perch.  many of which have been <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/tiffany-co-schlumberger-citrine-and-diamond-bird-on-a-rock-brooch/\">sold by FORTUNA®</a> throughout the years. When Tiffany hired Schlumberger, it was made clear he was to maintain his unique style in his creations for the jeweler. That much is evident in this <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-4CAKE0/tiffany-co-schlumberger-diamond-multi-gemstone-and-enamel-cow-brooch\">Tiffany &amp; Co.

The ranges in color are so abundant that different shades of tourmaline are often better known by their own individual names. You have undoubtedly heard of red-colored tourmalines or Rubellites; then there is Chroites, which is colorless; Paraiba, a neon-blue to green tourmaline variety that is colored by copper; and Indicolite, the rarest of them all, which possesses a very complex blue shade colored by iron. The presence of iron in Indicolites makes it the only blue gemstone of any kind that will show a drag response when a neodymium magnet is applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indicolite’s name originates from the Latin word for a blue-colored plant known as the “Indicum.” This shade of tourmaline is so rare that the gem commands some of the highest prices per carat among gem collectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The desirability of indicolites can be attributed to much more than just their chemical rarity; they are among the most beautiful gems in this world. Indicolite stones are strongly pleochroic, meaning they appear to be different colors when being viewed from different angles. When viewed through their vertical axis, indicolites appear darker in color than when seen through their horizontal axis.

Art Deco jewelry was particularly prominent between the ’20s and ’30s. This period was marked with celebration, as the era came after World War I. Designs were bold, fun and unique to celebrate and reflect individuality.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-How-can-you-tell-if-a-piece-is-art-deco-rev1-1024x416.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9362\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-How-can-you-tell-if-a-piece-is-art-deco-rev1-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-How-can-you-tell-if-a-piece-is-art-deco-rev1-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-How-can-you-tell-if-a-piece-is-art-deco-rev1-768x312.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/02-How-can-you-tell-if-a-piece-is-art-deco-rev1.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Can You Tell if a Piece Is Art Deco?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Art Deco has a distinct style that differentiates it from design periods before and after it. Art Deco saw the creation of jewelry in more masculine styles, from the shapes and motifs to gemstones used. Buying from dependable sellers and auction houses can ensure you get genuine Art Deco jewelry. For your own knowledge, you can tell if a piece is Art Deco by looking for these design features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Motifs:&nbsp;</strong>Design trends before the Art Deco period featured feminine, romantic and natural inspiration. The ’20s, ’30s and ’40s broke away from those trends. Instead, motifs were sharp and sought to imagine the future. Sleek lines, triangles, rectangles and geometric shapes graced pieces of jewelry from this era. Sunburst patterns were also popular, mixing the essence of rounded designs with straight features.</li><li><strong>Gemstones:&nbsp;</strong>Diamonds were the focus in Art Deco styles, but precious gemstones and other stones were also commonly put on display. Rubies, emeralds, sapphires, onyx and carnelian shine within the era’s bold and fun uses of color.</li><li><strong>Metals:</strong>&nbsp;Art Deco interior design and architecture featured dazzling gold, but jewelry focused on white gold and platinum. White jewelry was popular during this era as designers paired diamonds with white- or silver-toned metals.</li><li><strong>Enamel:</strong>&nbsp;Along with the traditional jewelry materials came the rise of enamel. The process involved melting powdered glass onto metal. Enameling allowed jewelers to add a variety of fun colors and sophisticated contrast to their pieces.</li><li><strong>Jewelry pieces:&nbsp;</strong>While just about every type of jewelry made an appearance during this era, it did have popular styles. Long pendants, long earrings, cocktail rings, diamond watches, layered bangles and detailed accessories like brooches appear in the Art Deco era. The jewelry suited the fashion of the time, which featured lower necklines and shorter hairstyles.</li><li><strong>Ring settings:&nbsp;</strong>If you are looking for Art Deco rings, you’ll want to understand the typical settings you’ll see in this era of jewelry. Cluster settings group a selection of gemstones, often diamonds, into a dazzling design. A prong setting uplifts a gemstone, which makes it appear larger. Those two designs followed a trend of making a gemstone appear larger than it was, giving jewelry buyers the look of more diamond for their money during hard times. Box settings follow the motifs of Art Deco’s geometrical designs with a squared setting.</li><li><strong>Worldly inspiration:&nbsp;</strong>In this era, jewelry designers gained a more worldly view and translated that into their creations. Japanese, Chinese and Egyptian art inspired unique motifs, materials and processes. Jade and coral make appearances in Art Deco jewelry, as well as dragon and pagoda motifs.</li><li><strong>Multi-functional jewelry:</strong>&nbsp;Another design trend inspired by hard times was jewelry that served multiple purposes. Items like double-clip brooches, for instance, could be worn as one piece or separated to accent collars, lapels or belts.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who Are the Most Common Designers of Art Deco?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By the Art Deco era, jewelry was seen as a way to express individuality. Jewelry collectors and everyday people alike wanted accessories that put their one-of-a-kind style on display. Plenty of designers and jewelers sought to meet the Art Deco trends and give people the unique pieces they wanted. If you’re searching for antique or vintage Art Deco jewelry, you’ll come across a variety of designers, many of whom you may recognize.&nbsp;Among the most common and famous designers of Art Deco jewelry are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Cartier:&nbsp;</strong>Though not the oldest, Cartier is among the most renowned jewelry houses in the world and is the most well-known of the Art Deco era. The jewelry house began as a watch company in 1847 with founder Louis-Francois Cartier. His grandsons later transformed the company into a global brand. Cartier designs for Art Deco rings attracted the world’s attention and that of royal families. Maison Cartier pioneered the use of platinum in jewelry, using the innovation to craft rings, tiaras and watches.</li><li><strong>Tiffany &amp; Co.:&nbsp;</strong>Another recognizable jewelry house, Tiffany &amp; Co. was founded in 1837. This jewelry house embraced the Art Deco style and trends. Tiffany &amp; Co. was known for creating engagement rings, various jewelry pieces and even interior decorations. Many Tiffany &amp; Co. pieces include dazzling diamonds and common geometrical features. You’ll also find emeralds and other precious gemstones.</li><li><strong>J.E. Caldwell:&nbsp;</strong>This jewelry retailer is well-known for James Emmott Caldwell’s creations during the Art Nouveau era. That period preceded Art Deco, but J.E. Caldwell would become synonymous with the ’20s design era. J.E. Caldwell’s designs are among famous and superior Art Deco pieces. The most common styles included diamond rings, which reflected cluster and box settings of the time. The retailer also created emerald rings, diamond and pearl necklaces and other items coveted for their quality.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/auctions/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/03-Bid-on-art-deco-jewelry-with-Fortuna-Auction-rev1-1024x416.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9363\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/03-Bid-on-art-deco-jewelry-with-Fortuna-Auction-rev1-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/03-Bid-on-art-deco-jewelry-with-Fortuna-Auction-rev1-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/03-Bid-on-art-deco-jewelry-with-Fortuna-Auction-rev1-768x312.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/03-Bid-on-art-deco-jewelry-with-Fortuna-Auction-rev1.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are the Most Common Pieces of Art Deco?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, a cultural interest in the Roaring ’20s sparked a desire for antique and vintage Art Deco jewelry.

In prior eras, diamonds were on the decline, but the post-World War I jewelry scene saw an influx of diamonds to use in unique designs. Common pieces of Art Deco jewelry that hold assortments of the dazzling gemstone and others include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Brooches:&nbsp;</strong>Clip brooches, in particular, created a stunning canvas. Jewelers decorated brooches with <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-1P6YWQ/cartier-art-deco-rock-crystal-and-diamond-brooch\">geometric details</a>, diamonds and precious gemstones.</li><li><strong>Sautoir necklaces:&nbsp;</strong>Long necklaces with <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-V9K1F/marcus-co-antique-natural-pearl-emerald-and-diamond-sautoir\">tassel details</a> were common during this era.

Today, he is widely known as the “King of Diamonds” and “Jeweler to the Stars” for his many accomplishments as a jeweler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1932, Winston founded Harry Winston, Inc. Today, Harry Winston, Inc., serves the elite globally throughout locations like New York City, London, Paris, Geneva, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in 1896, Winston began his journey as a jeweler&nbsp;as a young boy. His father, who immigrated to the United States from Ukraine, owned a small jewelry business that Winston happily worked in. There is a famous story  in which Winston, at only 12 years old, identified a 2-carat emerald at a pawn shop which he bought for $0.25 and sold for $800 two days later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an adult and businessman, Winston branded himself with his adoration of gemstones. In the 1940s, he revolutionized the jewelry industry with his innovative clustering technique. The technique celebrated the stones rather than the metal setting, maximizing the appeal of every piece. The resulting jewelry exuded life with three-dimensional designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Vintage-Harry-Winston-Diamond-Earrings-Fortuna-Important-Jewels-Auction-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Vintage Harry Winston Diamond Earrings - Fortuna Important Jewels Auction\" class=\"wp-image-5276\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Vintage-Harry-Winston-Diamond-Earrings-Fortuna-Important-Jewels-Auction-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Vintage-Harry-Winston-Diamond-Earrings-Fortuna-Important-Jewels-Auction-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Vintage-Harry-Winston-Diamond-Earrings-Fortuna-Important-Jewels-Auction-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Vintage-Harry-Winston-Diamond-Earrings-Fortuna-Important-Jewels-Auction-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Vintage-Harry-Winston-Diamond-Earrings-Fortuna-Important-Jewels-Auction.jpg 1081w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Vintage Harry Winston Cluster Diamond Earrings (Achieved $287,500 at FORTUNA’s 2019 <em>Important Jewels</em> auction)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same decade, Winston earned the title of “Jeweler to the Stars.” He was the first jeweler to lend diamonds to an Academy Awards actress, Jennifer Jones, who won Best Actress in 1944. Winston dressed royalty, too, selling the Duke and Duchess of Windsor his famed McLean Diamond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of his life in 1978, Winston owned the second largest collection of historical jewels, second to the British royal family. Harry Winston, Inc. lives on and follows Winston’s lifelong style and values.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are Some of Harry Winston’s Most Famous Pieces?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Harry Winston piece is sought after for unique angles, intriguing dimensions and organic shapes. But some of the most famous stones in the Winston collection are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Jonker</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jonker was a raw diamond found in South Africa in 1934. At the time, the Jonker was the fourth-largest uncut gem ever found, measuring 726 carats. News of the diamond excited the nation. And, naturally, Winston strived to add this raw diamond to his collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winston bought the diamond in 1935. He spent several months debating on the perfect way to cut the stone. Ultimately, the raw diamond was cut into 13 pieces, the largest called Jonker I—a 125.35-carat, emerald-shaped diamond.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hope Diamond</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/the-history-of-the-hope-diamond/\">Hope Diamond</a>&nbsp;is one of the most recognized diamonds in the world. It was found in India, dating back over four centuries. The first trade record dates back to 1666 when purchased by a French gem merchant. From there, the diamond met many owners, including King Louis XIV, Marie Antoinette and Lord Henry Hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1949, Winston obtained the diamond from mining heiress Evalyn Walsh McLean’s estate. After a decade, Winston donated the Hope Diamond as a “gift to the world”&nbsp;to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. You can see the Hope Diamond for yourself, as it still rests in the Smithsonian today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>President Vargas</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vargas, a 726.6-carat raw diamond, was discovered in Brazil in 1938. The raw diamond was named after&nbsp;Getúlio Vargas, the president of Brazil at the time. Winston obtained the diamond and cut it into 29 smaller diamonds, including a 48.26-carat, emerald-cut diamond, named President Vargas.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/contact-us/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/03-Get-Started-at-Fortuna-Today-1024x416.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9244\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/03-Get-Started-at-Fortuna-Today-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/03-Get-Started-at-Fortuna-Today-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/03-Get-Started-at-Fortuna-Today-768x312.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/03-Get-Started-at-Fortuna-Today.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get Started at FORTUNA® Today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re ready to buy or sell an alluring Harry Winston piece, contact FORTUNA.

It was there that the sizable Spanish galleon retrieved over 71 pounds of emeralds from its South American colonies. They would take their bounty to Panama City, Florida, where it took two months just to record the vast treasures they had amounted. From Florida, they proceeded onto Havana, to join the rest of the 28-ship Spanish fleet, <em>Tierra Firme</em> (Firm Land) and load the most valuable of their cargo onto the <em>Nuestra Señora de Atocha</em>, which was the largest and most heavily armed ship of them all. The <em>Atocha</em> would trail the rest of the convoy in case of an attack from behind. An attack came, but not from pirates or British naval ships; the <em>Atocha</em> was leaving Havana in the peak of hurricane season and succumbed to nature’s fury. Just four days after departing Cuba, the <em>Atocha</em> sunk—taking with it over 260 lives. The few survivors of the wreckage and the surviving Spanish ships marked the spot where the ship sank, but more hurricanes ruined any attempts to salvage the treasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>Atocha</em>&nbsp;alone carried cargo whose estimates range between $250 and $500 million, including silver from Peru and Mexico, gold and emeralds from Colombia, pearls from Venezuela, as well as more common goods including worked silverware, tobacco, and bronze cannons. Muzo emeralds are coveted worldwide for their exceptional quality and richness in color. They are named after a town in the Colombian Andes, known as the emerald capital of the world. In fact, the main economy of Muzo remains to this day, 75% emerald mining. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did this 9.47-Carat Fine Colombian Muzo Emerald from the <em>Nuestra Señora de Atocha</em> end up in FORTUNA®’s<strong> </strong><em>May Jewels &amp; Watches</em> auction? Over 300 years after the shipwreck, an unlikely hero would discover the treasure. Mel Fisher, a former chicken farmer turned diving shop owner, spent 16 years searching for the famed treasure. While Mel found many clues scattered across the Florida coast, such as copper cannons that were inscribed as belonging to the <em>Atocha</em>, the actual shipwreck continued to elude Mel and his team of divers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3405.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9464\" width=\"496\" height=\"545\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3405.jpg 700w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_3405-273x300.jpg 273w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px\"><figcaption>Treasure hunter, Mel Fisher holding a jar of Colombian Emeralds and some Gold recovered from the Nuestra Señora de Atocha. <em>(Courtesy of Mel Fisher’s Treasures.)</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Mel continued to search for the ship with his children, and world-record-setting diver, his wife, Dolores.  On July 20, 1985,  his son Kane, radioed into his father to let him know, they had finally “found the motherlode.” They had found the bow of the ship, and with it, over $400 million in goods. After diving for minimum wage for 16 years, this would change the Fisher’s lives forever—if they got to keep it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state of Florida attempted to claim the treasure as theirs, but the Supreme Court of Florida ruled in favor of Fisher and his team. The case could easily have gone another way; only a few years later, a judge ruled the finders of another Spanish shipwreck had to return the treasure to Spain. </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:50px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG-3401-1024x710.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9467\" width=\"522\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG-3401-1024x710.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG-3401-300x208.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG-3401-768x532.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG-3401-1536x1064.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG-3401.jpg 1726w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 522px) 100vw, 522px\"><figcaption>American singer, Jimmy Buffet celebrating with the crew behind Silver bars recovered from the ship. <em>(Photo by Don Kincaid via Mel Fisher’s Treasures.)</em></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The images of Mel smiling with glee rocked the media.

Even the famed Argyle mine in Australia, known for producing over 80% of the world’s pink diamonds, finds them only amongst less than 1% of its stock. The value of diamonds like these is expected to skyrocket after the closure of this mine in 2020. In fact, according to the Fancy Color Research Foundation (FCRF), the value of pink diamonds already rose 116 percent between 2010 and 2020. This rise is greater than that of any other diamond,  including the extremely rare blue diamond—making pink diamonds a great investment, as well as a wonderful engagement ring.<br><br>Now that the Argyle mine has shut, where else can high-quality pink diamonds be sourced? The stones can also be found in Russia, Tanzania, South Africa, and occasionally Brazil. Yet, there is no reported regular production from any mine. Pink diamonds are also graded for the intensity of the color, which follows an internationally recognized scale of: faint, very light, light, fancy light, fancy, fancy intense, fancy deep, and fancy vivid. And like other diamonds, the stronger the color, the higher the price tag. The price per carat of a natural fancy pink diamond can range anywhere between $100,000 per carat to over $1,000,000 per carat.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“I believe in pink.”</p><cite>Audrey Hepburn</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-53SOGY/543-carat-fancy-intense-orangy-pink-diamond-ring-gia-certified\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156036059-5d86b8f773e8102227cc0b44caa4993312a2db2d38daed8ff7fdda7e2b046a14-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10562\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156036059-5d86b8f773e8102227cc0b44caa4993312a2db2d38daed8ff7fdda7e2b046a14-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156036059-5d86b8f773e8102227cc0b44caa4993312a2db2d38daed8ff7fdda7e2b046a14-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156036059-5d86b8f773e8102227cc0b44caa4993312a2db2d38daed8ff7fdda7e2b046a14-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156036059-5d86b8f773e8102227cc0b44caa4993312a2db2d38daed8ff7fdda7e2b046a14-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156036059-5d86b8f773e8102227cc0b44caa4993312a2db2d38daed8ff7fdda7e2b046a14-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156036059-5d86b8f773e8102227cc0b44caa4993312a2db2d38daed8ff7fdda7e2b046a14-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>5.43-Carat Fancy Intense Orangy Pink Marquise Diamond Ring, offered in FORTUNA®’s upcoming <em>November Jewels &amp; Watches</em> auction.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Pink diamonds aren’t only special because of their rarity. Part of the allure of pink diamonds is their mystery. To this day, gemologists aren’t entirely sure how the pink diamond obtains its color. Unlike other Fancy Color Diamonds, the pink shade is not caused from chemical impurities that cause some diamonds to appear blue or yellow. Some suspect that the enormous pressure undergone by pink diamonds during formation is a likely cause, though others believe it could be related to a seismic shock that impacted the stone’s molecular structure. As a result, the color and hue of lab-grown pink diamonds cannot be replicated to appear even close to that of a true natural pink diamond. <br><br>Pink diamonds became the talk of the town and rose in demand after the engagement of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck in 2002. The star popped the question with an eye-popping fancy pink diamond ring by Harry Winston. The recent rekindling of romance between the two stars has sparked much speculation over whether the return of “Bennifer” would also mean the return of her pink diamond ring. The pink diamond engagement ring craze even spread to other celebrity couples, such as Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Victoria and David Beckham, and Margot Robbie and Tom Ackerley.<br><br>Throughout the eighteenth century, pink was the most fashionable color for both gentlemen and ladies. By the nineteenth century, color was feminized, as Euro-American men adopted black suits. In the 1940’s, pink began to be used to as a gender signifier in babies, a result of clever marketing to sell more baby clothes. Since then, pink has seen huge transformations. From its association with Barbie and femininity, it has now become a powerful, at times, even “punk” color—or so says Dr. Valerie Steele, director of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Pink is the only true rock and roll color.” </p><cite>Paul Simonon,  bass guitarist for The Clash</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-53SOGY/543-carat-fancy-intense-orangy-pink-diamond-ring-gia-certified\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LOT-Z1002-copy-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10583\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LOT-Z1002-copy-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LOT-Z1002-copy-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LOT-Z1002-copy-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LOT-Z1002-copy-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LOT-Z1002-copy.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\"></a><figcaption>This 5.43-Carat Fancy Intense Orangy Pink Marquise will be offered this November for an estimated $420,000–$460,000.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>While the origin of a pink diamond’s color is still heavily debated by geologists, the color pink has captured people for centuries, inspiring such devotion and iconic phrases as “la vie en rose” and “I believe in pink.” In popular culture, pink has been used to depict an array of moods, from the fun-loving attitude of Elle Woods in “Legally Blonde” to Elvis Presley’s cool pink Cadillac. In Audrey Hepburn’s film, “Funny Face,” women were encouraged to do away with the dull beige and black of everyday life and “Think Pink!”. The color is truly electric and appropriate for all occasions. So whether your style is more “Pretty in Pink” or “Punk Pink,” a pink diamond engagement ring is sure to inspire equal feelings of love, romance, and fortitude in all who wear it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><br><br><br></p>\n\t\t","date":"2021-06-09T22:16:05.000Z"},{"id":76,"authorId":4,"categoryId":4,"title":"What Are Moonstones?","content":"\n<p>With its soft, mysterious milky glow, the moonstone has been a favorite of jewelry lovers for centuries. But what exactly are moonstones?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often believed to be a gem, the moonstone is actually a natural crystal mineral variety of the feldspar group. It’s made up of potassium aluminum silicate. The moonstone’s ghostly glow is caused by light moving across the stone — much like moonlight gliding through the clouds on a dark night.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where Did Moonstones Come About?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Moonstones have been a staple of jewelry collections for ages. Ancient Eastern cultures obsessed over the stone, believing that it was created by literal moonbeams. Moonstones are often still used in Sri Lanka and India for spiritual purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moonstone has found an important place within modern jewelry as well. In the early 1900s, the stone became a focal point of design — often being used as a small accent stone in Art Nouveau-themed statues and art pieces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The popularity of the moonstone has ebbed and flowed with style and fashion trends. While the <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/art-nouveau-jewelry/\">Art Nouveau</a> period produced many famous pieces of moonstone jewelry, it was short-lived and was soon replaced by the Art Deco movement, which emphasized diamonds and gemstones. It wasn’t until the 1960s that the moonstone came back into fashion, popular in rings and necklaces of the counterculture movement. In the 1990s, the moonstone once again became a fashion trend with designers incorporating the stone into the New Age movement of design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of their breathtaking appearance, moonstones will continue to remain popular among jewelry collectors for ages to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-42Y4W2/tiffany-co-antique-moonstone-and-sapphire-necklace\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/129879919-948648d5743e85f8eb81801a0b831df0c38d16f2fdf4b597faf6a87510d43acd-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8850\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/129879919-948648d5743e85f8eb81801a0b831df0c38d16f2fdf4b597faf6a87510d43acd-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/129879919-948648d5743e85f8eb81801a0b831df0c38d16f2fdf4b597faf6a87510d43acd-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/129879919-948648d5743e85f8eb81801a0b831df0c38d16f2fdf4b597faf6a87510d43acd-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/129879919-948648d5743e85f8eb81801a0b831df0c38d16f2fdf4b597faf6a87510d43acd-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/129879919-948648d5743e85f8eb81801a0b831df0c38d16f2fdf4b597faf6a87510d43acd-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/129879919-948648d5743e85f8eb81801a0b831df0c38d16f2fdf4b597faf6a87510d43acd-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Tiffany &amp; Co.

In spiritual traditions such as feng shui, the moon represents divine feminine energy. The moonstone is believed by some to balance hormonal and reproductive issues, as the waxing and waning of the moon is connected to fertility cycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the moonstone is thought to represent compassion and empathy as well as the creative and intuitive power of feminine energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps best known as one of the birthstones for June, moonstone’s connection to both Roman and Greek lunar deities is believed to harness the power of love, passion and great luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are Moonstones Valuable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The moonstone’s value is based almost entirely on its appearance. The clearer the stone, the more valuable it will be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common reasons for the moonstone to be less valuable is tiny tension cracks inside of the stone. These cracks are known as centipedes, and they interfere with the stone’s adularescence, or unique milky-blue luster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for moonstones can range anywhere from $10 to over $1000. Clear moonstones that are free of cracks and centipedes will command the highest prices on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where to Buy and Sell Moonstones</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you interested in selling or purchasing moonstones?

Cartier is a French-based luxury goods company specializing in jewelry and watchmaking. Here, you’ll learn more about the history of Cartier, as well as how to sell and buy coveted Cartier collectibles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The History Behind Cartier</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cartier’s origin began with Louis-François&nbsp;Cartier, the founder, born in Paris in 1819. He spent most of his early adulthood as an apprentice under a master watchmaker. In 1847, Cartier bought the store from his apprentice—the beginning of Cartier’s successful journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, Cartier’s craft extended from watchmaking into jewelry. He bought what he could afford and made the best pieces he could, strengthening his craft with every piece made. Cartier would sell his pieces and invest the profits into buying bigger and better materials, his work building the Cartier business to new levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the late 1800s, Louis-Francois Cartier’s son, Alfred Cartier, took over the business. Around this time, France’s elites were fleeing from France in the heat of a Socialist revolution. They were looking for any way out, including by selling their finest jewelry and watches at a desperately low price. Alfred bought these pieces, and from there, the Cartier business skyrocketed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a century of growth throughout the 1900s, Cartier grew to be a well-known jewelry and watchmaking brand. Although Cartier is no longer family-owned, it’s still widely successful, operating more than 200 stores in 125 countries, including London, New York and Paris.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/02-Some-of-Cartiers-Most-Sought-After-Pieces-RE-1-1024x416.jpg\" alt=\"sought after Cartier pieces\" class=\"wp-image-9869\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/02-Some-of-Cartiers-Most-Sought-After-Pieces-RE-1-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/02-Some-of-Cartiers-Most-Sought-After-Pieces-RE-1-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/02-Some-of-Cartiers-Most-Sought-After-Pieces-RE-1-768x312.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/02-Some-of-Cartiers-Most-Sought-After-Pieces-RE-1.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Some of Cartier’s Most Sought-After Pieces</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of Cartier’s pieces are highly sought after. Collectors enjoy the exclusivity of the brand, seeking both antique and new pieces to add to their collection. Some of the most sought-after Cartier pieces are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Cartier Love Bracelet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps one of the most well-known Cartier jewelry is the Cartier Love bracelet. Aldo Cipullo, who is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/cipullo-book-cartier-love-bracelet\">only man allowed to have his signature</a>&nbsp;on a Cartier piece, originally designed the unique bracelet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bracelet’s design is relatively simple, but its symbolism makes it so popular. The Cartier Love bracelet doesn’t slip onto the wrist like most bracelets. Rather, it’s fixed onto a wearer’s wrist by two screw heads, requiring a special screwdriver to apply and remove the bracelet. The idea is to give the tool to your lover so only they can access your bracelet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cartier Love bracelet is available online in various styles and sizes, and it’s widely popular with collectors and jewelry enthusiasts alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Cartier Tank Watch</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cartier Tank watch’s design, crafted in the early 1900s, is inspired by the tracks of the French war tank Renault FT-17. The defining characteristics of the Tank watch are its rectangular face and bold hour markers. The original Tank Watch used silver metal and black leather. But, since its creation, you can find over 50 different models online currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Trinity De Cartier Ring</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trinity collection contains many models of earrings, necklaces and bracelets, but the most sought-after Trinity style is the original ring. The ring has three intertwining pieces representing the three stages of romance—friendship, fidelity and love. To further symbolize those stages, each piece is its own metal, including pink, yellow and white gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Panthère De Cartier Ring</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/cartier-panthere-history/\">One of Cartier’s most recognized symbols is the panther.</a> It began its association with the brand in 1914 when Louis-Francois Cartier commissioned an artist to paint a bejeweled lady posing with the wild cat. The piece was called “Dame a la Panthère” and was featured in one of Cartier’s most famous advertising campaigns. Admirers received the panther so well, it solidified the piece into the Cartier brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the century, you can find the Cartier panther integrated into many of the brand’s works, including the Panthère&nbsp;de Cartier ring. There are currently over 40 models of the panther ring, which you can find in different metals and with various adorned gemstones and unique interpretations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Cartier Juste Un Clou Bracelet</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The name of the Juste un Clou bracelet directly translates to “just a nail”—and that’s exactly what it is. The original design is a simple, long golden nail, wrapped to form the shape of a bracelet. The style is minimalist, proving Cartier can make anything beautiful. Now, you can find varying styles, including different metals and gemstone adornments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to Buy or Sell Cartier Jewelry and Watches</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you ready to part from your Cartier jewelry to make room for new pieces in your collection?

Their skills working with platinum, the newest and most in demand metal in the jewelry industry, were in high demand. In 1912, the brothers were joined by their 4 other brothers and 3 sisters and opened a workshop of their own on Maiden Lane in Lower NYC . The firm quickly established itself as the “jeweler’s jeweler,” designing pieces for large jewelry houses such as Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, Cartier and Tiffany &amp; Co. In 1939, the firm won a gold medal for Best in Show at the New York World’s Fair for its extraordinary collection of unique floral brooches.

Now the sole proprietor, Wilsdorf chose the name Rolex because he wanted something people of all origins could pronounce. Plus, he thought the name resembled the sound of a watch being wound.</li><li><strong>1910:&nbsp;</strong>Rolex becomes the first wristwatch brand to earn an independently ratified certificate of a chronometric performance — essentially a very high degree of excellence in timekeeping.</li><li><strong>1914:&nbsp;</strong>The Kew Observatory awarded the Rolex watch with a “Class A” precision certificate. This was a monumental award as it is usually given to marine chronometers, and it was the first time a London wristwatch won the award.</li><li><strong>1919:&nbsp;</strong>Wilsdorf moved his Rolex brand from London to Geneva because of newly imposed taxes that made metals too expensive. He chose Geneva so he could be closer to his Bienne-based suppliers.</li><li><strong>1926:&nbsp;</strong>The Rolex Oyster was released. This was an exciting release, as the watch was marketed as the world’s first waterproof watch.</li><li><strong>1927:&nbsp;</strong>A year after the Oyster release date, Wilsdorf gave famous swimmer Mercedes Gleitze the watch.

Some of their most famous and foundational pieces, however, are:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Oyster</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Made in 1926, the Oyster revolutionized watchmaking. It’s recognized as the first waterproof case, strategically designed with 10 parts and sealed zones, protected against water and dust. The design enabled watch-wearers to wear their watches during various activities, including swimming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like other styles, the Oyster is currently available in many colors and sizes. It has two original dial colors, however — black with white gold and silver with gold accents. The watches are signed with “superlative chronometer official certified,” a tribute to Rolex’s 1910 recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Daytona</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolex&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/rolex-daytona-history/\">introduced the Daytona</a>&nbsp;in 1962. It’s named after the famous Florida city, home of the Daytona International Speedway. The Daytona allows racers to measure elapsed time and calculate their average speed using three subdials — small seconds, 30-minute and 12-hour counters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original Daytona has “Cosmograph” engraved in red under the Rolex logo. In the early 1960s, “Daytona” replaced Cosmograph, and the model continued to advance from there. Original Daytonas don’t have a date window nor engraving on the case backs. But, they do have two engravings on the sides, stating the model and serial numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. GMT-Master</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the mid-1950s, pilots began traveling longer distances across different time zones. Pan Am requested Rolex to make an aviator watch that could keep track of these different time zones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolex created the GMT-Master that displayed a fourth time — Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), hence the name GMT-Master. Now, the watch displays the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), following the 1972 transition established by the Aviation Industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Day-Date</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1956, the luxurious Day-Date Rolex made its debut. This style is the first waterproof watch with a self-winding chronometer. The Day-Date displays the full calendar day along with the date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Day-Date is synonymous with luxury and prestige. The watch has been through many different styles and configurations over time—changing dial colors, size and design. This Rolex timepiece has been popularized by celebrities, politicians, CEOs and other high-profile individuals. Most famously, U.S. President Lyndon B.

The gem comes in a range of colors and looks stunning in many different types of jewelry, though it is a favorite in necklaces and earrings. Found in areas within Australia and Ethiopia, the opal makes for a striking centerpiece with color and intensity that even surpass the beauty of a diamond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Precious opals are known for their play of color or iridescence, as they can flash many different hues within the same stone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is the Origin of Opals?</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2017-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10348\" width=\"437\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2017-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2017-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2017-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2017-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2017-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2017-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\"><figcaption>Antique Opal and Diamond Brooch, achieved $4,063 at FORTUNA’s 2020 <em>August Jewels &amp; Watches</em> auction. </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Opals are a combination of silica and water. Their formation process began millions of years ago, when rainwater seeped down into areas of the earth filled with silica-rich sandstone. The water mixed with and carried silica particles with it as it traveled down further into the ground, becoming trapped in cracks and crevices. Eventually, the water evaporated, leaving a silica deposit behind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As rainwater continued to flow down into these crevices, the deposits gradually built up to form beautiful gems. Australia is the world’s leading source of opals, although Ethiopia is a strong competitor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do Opals Mean Anything?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Opals have a range of meanings because they come in a range of colors, shapes and sizes.&nbsp;In Greek mythology, opals were thought to be the result of Zeus’s tears falling to the earth. Other cultures believed the rainbow’s virgin goddess turned herself into an opal to escape suitors’ pursuits. As a result, the gem became associated with offering protection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The colors of the opal itself have symbolized passion, love and spontaneity. Other ideas of happiness, loyalty and confidence are also attached to these vibrant stones, as is the belief that opal can attract money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How are Opals Valued?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some famous pieces of opal jewelry have been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The price is determined by a few factors, with the origin being perhaps one of the most important. Australian opals are highly desired because Australia has been history’s longest opal source, creating a reliable and well-respected reputation for the nation. Ethiopia is still new to the market, making their opals a little more affordable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the origin is confirmed, the class and body tone are the next two determining factors in value. The class identifies whether the opal is entirely authentic or is a doublet or triplet. In the latter, the piece is composed of a slice of genuine opal and one or two pieces of another material to give the opal a darker or more full appearance.&nbsp;Body tone is the background or foundational color of the opal, typically ranging from black to light. The darker the background, the more valuable the opal, as a black background displays refracted light more vividly. Genuine solid black opals are quite rare and can command extremely high prices at market. An example can be seen below in a spectacular ring from our September 2018 <em>Important Jewels</em> auction. The ring, a <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-19Z3PW/louis-comfort-tiffany-art-nouveau-black-opal-diamond-and-enamel-ring\">Louis Comfort Tiffany Art Nouveau </a>design with a stunning black opal, achieved $12,5000 at auction. The strong play-of-color and mystique innate to precious opals made them a very popular choice for jewels during the <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/art-nouveau-jewelry/\">Art Nouveau</a> era. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-4RUNMQ/buccellati-black-opal-and-enamel-earrings\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2047-edited-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10383\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2047-edited-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2047-edited-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2047-edited-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2047-edited-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2047-edited-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2047-edited-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2047-edited-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"></a><figcaption>Buccellati Black Opal and Enamel Earrings, FORTUNA’s 2021 <em>July Jewels &amp; Watches</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-19Z3PW/louis-comfort-tiffany-art-nouveau-black-opal-diamond-and-enamel-ring\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1035-edited-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10382\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1035-edited-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1035-edited-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1035-edited-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1035-edited-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1035-edited-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1035-edited-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1035-edited-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"></a><figcaption>Louis Comfort Tiffany Art Nouveau Black Opal Diamond and Enamel Ring, FORTUNA’s 2018 September <em>Important Jewels</em>.</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Visit FORTUNA® to Buy or Sell Opal Jewelry at Auction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking for opal jewels that can bring life and joy to your favorite looks or if you have opal jewelry to sell, trust FORTUNA for the best possible quality and deal.

Color centers result from anomalies in a crystal’s atom arrangement; a change in the crystal lattice due to intense heat exposure during the stone’s formation can sometimes cause pink graining. Because the pink color comes from atomic-level distortions to the diamond’s crystal structure, pink diamonds cannot be replicated through laboratory treatment in the same way, making these gemstones all the more spectacular. For more on pink diamonds, <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/pretty-in-pink-diamonds/\">click here</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Red:</strong>&nbsp;The origin of a red diamond’s color is believed to be the same as that of pink diamonds, but in a more concentrated form. This theory of red diamonds being dark pink diamonds is supported by the fact that red diamonds can be only found in a single color intensity. Red is the rarest diamond color. Less than 30 genuine red diamonds have been found and cut, and they can cost up to $1 million per carat.</li><li><strong>Blue:&nbsp;</strong>Natural blue diamonds derive their color from the presence of boron. Their hue can also be associated with hydrogen or caused by radiation exposure.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Green:</strong>&nbsp;Naturally colored green diamonds are scarce. The displacement of carbon atoms from their normal positions causes these diamonds to develop their signature color. This phenomenon can happen artificially due to treatment by radiation or naturally when diamond deposits lie near radioactive rocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Black:&nbsp;</strong>Black diamonds have many fractures that yield the stone’s distinct dark hue due to graphitization. Most get their color from large quantities of minute mineral inclusions such as hematite, pyrite or graphite that extend throughout the stone.</li><li><strong>Brown:</strong> A natural brown diamond develops its color due to parallel brown grain lines arising due to molecular arrangement distortion.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156817157-2ee9386a7504677c4ebc904673324cbada57b6b9903a656e63d75b1561f2b0c3-1-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10558\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156817157-2ee9386a7504677c4ebc904673324cbada57b6b9903a656e63d75b1561f2b0c3-1-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156817157-2ee9386a7504677c4ebc904673324cbada57b6b9903a656e63d75b1561f2b0c3-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156817157-2ee9386a7504677c4ebc904673324cbada57b6b9903a656e63d75b1561f2b0c3-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156817157-2ee9386a7504677c4ebc904673324cbada57b6b9903a656e63d75b1561f2b0c3-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156817157-2ee9386a7504677c4ebc904673324cbada57b6b9903a656e63d75b1561f2b0c3-1-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/156817157-2ee9386a7504677c4ebc904673324cbada57b6b9903a656e63d75b1561f2b0c3-1-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>1.01-Carat Fancy Deep Pink Diamond Ring (Lot 2099, <em>November Jewels &amp; Watches</em>).</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-12T154559.022-1-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10561\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-12T154559.022-1-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-12T154559.022-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-12T154559.022-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-12T154559.022-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-12T154559.022-1-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-12T154559.022-1-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Fancy Green-Blue and Fancy Greenish Blue Diamond Drop Earrings (Lot 2100, <em>November Jewels &amp; Watches</em>).</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Rarity of Colored Diamonds</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most diamonds mined throughout the world, even if they contain traces of yellow, are considered colorless.

As it moved through early modernism and World War II, the time’s signature designs reflected the nuanced changes of history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its distinctive style began in France, with the first designs by Van Cleef &amp; Arpels appearing at the New York World’s Fair in 1939. Over the next decade, the iconic designs became popular throughout the United States. As World War II ravaged Europe, the United States carried on the European-inspired design.&nbsp;American designs took much inspiration from the new style, adapting past designs to fresh looks with bright colors and dramatic aesthetics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the world moved into the 1950s, retro jewelry played a leading role in developing art and design toward modernism, representing the post-World War II era’s futuristic vision. It became a popular image of a new larger-than-life design motif that reflected real-world objects with glamour and excitement.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-8Q52Y/boucheron-retro-gold-and-diamond-clip\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/227-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10539\" width=\"453\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/227-1.jpg 880w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/227-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/227-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/227-1-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\"></a><figcaption>This Boucheron Retro Gold and Diamond Clip (FORTUNA®’s April 2017 <em>Spring Jewels</em> auction).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Major Influences on Retro Jewelry Pieces</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Wars had a profound impact on Retro jewelry. In the midst of the wartime era, patriotic and industrial themes appeared on many retro pieces. Accessories such as tank tread bracelets and red, white and blue stones became increasingly common, as did jewelry with military emblems and motifs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest influences on jewels of the period was the impact of the war on the supply of precious metal and gemstones. Platinum, which had been increasingly popular during the Art Deco era, was rare and often forbidden for sale, and many precious metals had to be rationed for the war effort. Palladium was substituted for platinum and low carat gold alloys, gold mixed heavily with copper, were used to make the most of the gold that was available. The innovative usage of gold alloys was widespread and jewelry of the period often had a reddish tinge to the gold, due to the copper, or incorporated tri-color gold designs. Similarly, precious gems became rarer because of shortages in the supply chain. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/k3013-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10460\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/k3013-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/k3013-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/k3013-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/k3013-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/k3013-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/k3013-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Retro Diamond Necklace from FORTUNA®’s recent <em>November Jewels &amp; Watches</em> auction.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Signature Pieces of the Retro Jewelry Era</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Glamorous and dramatic, Retro jewelry reflected new vivacity as the world moved forward from a tumultuous beginning of the century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brooches were a popular accessory of this period, added to a scarf, handbag or dress for accentuated elegance. Retro pins were often an elegant touch to soften the hard lines and somber colors of wartime fashion, and designs such as scrolls, fans and jeweled fruit became quite common. The fabric-like and ribbon designs seen in the Retro Sapphire and Ruby Brooch and Retro Tri-color Gold Ruby and Diamond Brooch, pictured below, are quintessentially Retro.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-26E8JD/retro-sapphire-and-ruby-brooch\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3037-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10452\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3037-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3037-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3037-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3037-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3037-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3037-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Retro Sapphire and Ruby Brooch (2021 <em>January Jewels &amp; Watches</em> auction).</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-42Y4XQ/retro-tri-color-gold-ruby-and-diamond-brooch\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2227-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10455\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2227-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2227-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2227-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2227-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2227-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2227-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a><figcaption>Retro Tri-color Gold Ruby and Diamond Brooch (2021 <em>January Jewels &amp; Watches</em> auction).</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the rings of the time, cocktail rings were highly fashionable.

These were flexible gold strap bracelets composed of brick-like or hexagonal plaques. The style caught fire and many of the major jewelry houses adopted the design, as seen in the above <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-GE5WD/tiffany-co-ruby-and-diamond-necklace\">Cartier Retro Bracelet</a> and <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-GE5WD/tiffany-co-ruby-and-diamond-necklace\">Tiffany &amp; Co. Ruby and Diamond Necklace</a> from prior sales. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another particularly fashionable style of bracelet was to decorate wide gold cuffs by adding recycled pins or charms, particularly from the preceding Art Deco years. Shortages due to the war often meant that clients had to work creatively with their jewelers to remodel or repurpose existing jewels.  An excellent example of the trend is this Very Fine Retro Bangle Bracelet with Art Deco Diamond Charms. Oversized woven and braided gold strap bracelets of the time were often also the ideal place to conceal a watch for a touch of functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-07T171838.746-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10390\" width=\"465\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-07T171838.746-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-07T171838.746-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-07T171838.746-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-07T171838.746-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-07T171838.746-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/retrievePhoto-2021-10-07T171838.746-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\"><figcaption>Retro Diamond Charm Hinged Bangle Bracelet, offered in FORTUNA®’s recent <em>November Jewels &amp; Watches</em> auction.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Many changes toward bolder designs and patterns also reflected the changing times.

The Fosters established a mill there, and what began as tenant housing quickly grew into a flourishing town known as Fostoria. The Fosters brought a progressive, idyllic existence, making sure to give back to the community. Schools, churches, a store, a hotel, and more were all run by the family. The only thing not run by the mill was the post office. Today, the Fosters are remembered as&nbsp;progressive employers creating a fulfilling living experience for all lucky enough to live in a Foster-held community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fosters learned to enjoy their vast wealth, investing in fine jewelry as well. In 1945, one of Foster’s grandsons, also named John, spotted this luminous Art Deco Cat’s Eye Chrysoberyl and Diamond Ring at William Schmidt &amp; Sons, right here by Rockefeller Center half a century ago.

In chrysoberyl gems, fine silk crystal inclusions create this effect. When light obliquely strikes such a stone, it usually creates a shadow effect within the gem. The side opposite the light is a rich brown, while the side facing the light is yellowish-white. This so-called “milk and honey” look is characteristic of the finest cat’s eyes and makes them so desired. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This exquisite example of a cat’s eye chrysoberyl was offered in FORTUNA®’s <em><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-53C7VW/november-jewels-watches?limit=96\">November Jewels &amp; Watches</a></em> auction for an estimated $6,000–$8,000, and achieved a final price of $11,250. <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-54U0KF/art-deco-cats-eye-chrysoberyl-and-diamond-ring\">For more details on this lot, click here.</a></p>\n\t\t","date":"2021-11-01T18:01:31.000Z"},{"id":85,"authorId":4,"categoryId":4,"title":"The Beauty of Kashmir Sapphires","content":"\n<p>Kashmir is a region of Northern India known for producing some of the most beautiful sapphires at market.&nbsp;The sapphire trade in Kashmir is relatively recent, beginning in the 19th century, while other places have centuries of history.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sapphires possess a rich history of being much sought after as beautiful additions to jewelry or standalone jewels.

Gem-quality Kashmir sapphires are unmatched for their gorgeous blue color, a blue that is often described as a “corn-flower” blue or having a “velvety” appearance—as pictured above in the <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-13O0RZ/edwardian-162-carat-kashmir-sapphire-and-diamond-platinum-pin\">Edwardian 1.62-Carat Kashmir Sapphire and Diamond Platinum Pin</a>, a highlight of FORTUNA®’s <em><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/auctions/1-10K74N/fine-jewels-sale-1022\">2018 June <em>Fine Jewels</em></a></em> sale in the past. When compared to most other blue sapphires, the richness and quality of color in fine Kashmir sapphires are truly in a league of their own. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The velvety softness of Kashmir sapphires can be attributed to minute liquid filled cavities within the stone that can only be seen with a high-power microscope. Under magnification, Kashmir sapphires also exhibit a unique phenomenon known as “zoning,” where the blue hue seems to be concentrated in parallel bands. Unlike most other sapphires, Kashmir sapphires lose none of their vibrancy or strength of color under artificial light.    &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-19Z43C/victorian-430-carat-kashmir-sapphire-and-diamond-ring\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71654266-0119f21f0f01e2740d49c0a5bd887e2a355d33a8e5f1460cc8cdbd0e79c96499-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian 4.30ct Kashmir Sapphire and Diamond Ring - Fortuna NYC\" class=\"wp-image-4917\" width=\"457\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71654266-0119f21f0f01e2740d49c0a5bd887e2a355d33a8e5f1460cc8cdbd0e79c96499-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71654266-0119f21f0f01e2740d49c0a5bd887e2a355d33a8e5f1460cc8cdbd0e79c96499-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71654266-0119f21f0f01e2740d49c0a5bd887e2a355d33a8e5f1460cc8cdbd0e79c96499-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/71654266-0119f21f0f01e2740d49c0a5bd887e2a355d33a8e5f1460cc8cdbd0e79c96499-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\"></a><figcaption>Victorian 4.30ct Kashmir Sapphire and Diamond Ring, achieved $187,500 at FORTUNA’s 2018 September <em>Important Jewels</em> auction.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Rare Are Kashmir Sapphires?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kashmir sapphires are rare, and their presence at auctions are scarce compared to most other colored gemstones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unrest in the Kashmir region, where India and Pakistan have a longstanding dispute, makes further mining more difficult, contributing to the scarcity of the stone. Very little has been taken from the Kashmir mines since the early part of the last century. With no new gems coming out, the ones already in circulation are even more in demand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kashmir sapphires remain the crown jewel in many collections. They have become more sought after as their scarcity increases, and finding a quality one at auction is considered a major achievement for those who appreciate their deep color, and velvety, soft smoothness. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Find Kashmir Sapphires With FORTUNA®</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While origin is very important to a sapphire’s value, it is also critical to note that a Kashmir origin is not an automatic indicator of the gemstone’s quality. FORTUNA’s jewelry specialists have years of experience evaluating rare gemstones, including Kashmir sapphires, and are available to consult whether you are seeking a Kashmir sapphire to add to your collection or are looking to sell.

This semiprecious quartz variant is one of the most popular gemstones. Depending on the version, citrine exhibits an attractive golden brown to pale yellow color that closely resembles topaz. Examples of specific color options include bright and deep orange, golden yellow, lemon and reddish-brown.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-1GIC7F/cartier-art-deco-citrine-diamond-and-onyx-pin\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/122-HERO-min-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11471\" width=\"370\" height=\"478\"></a><figcaption>Cartier Art Deco Citrine Diamond and Onyx Pin<br>Sold for $9,375</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Citrine consists of large, visible crystals of quartz, the second most abundant mineral found in the earth’s crust. Although quartz is common, natural citrine is relatively rare. Madagascar and the Ural Mountains of Russia are among the few locations in the world where it’s possible to mine citrine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Natural citrine may develop in the form of geodes, which are secondary geological formations found in rock cavities. Geodes begin as mud balls in sedimentary rock or bubbles in volcanic rock. Over time, the outer shell of the geode hardens into a spherical shape. Citrine may also occur as veins of quartz beneath the earth’s surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is the Meaning of Citrine Stone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ancient Greeks started using citrine as a gemstone around 300 B.C. The name derives from the Latin word “citrus” and the French word “citron” due to its yellowish hue. The color also exhibits the warmth, energy and power of the sun, another reason citrine stones are favorites of jewelry buyers around the world. Finding “natural” citrine is rare — in most cases, a heat-treating process transforms quartz into citrine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-2M9249/tiffany-co-schlumberger-citrine-and-diamond-bird-on-a-rock-brooch\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/84-Bird-on-Rock-min-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11472\" width=\"417\" height=\"539\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/84-Bird-on-Rock-min-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/84-Bird-on-Rock-min-232x300.jpg 232w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/84-Bird-on-Rock-min-768x994.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/84-Bird-on-Rock-min-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/84-Bird-on-Rock-min-1583x2048.jpg 1583w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/84-Bird-on-Rock-min-scaled.jpg 1978w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px\"></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/tiffany-co-schlumberger-citrine-and-diamond-bird-on-a-rock-brooch/\">Tiffany &amp; Co.

Because of its remarkable transparency, ensuring the color’s evenness throughout the stone is a primary consideration when purchasing a citrine stone. Small blemishes or cracks are also more likely to show.</li><li><strong>Hardness:&nbsp;</strong>As a quartz derivative, citrine is harder than most minerals. It measures 7.0 on the Mohs hardness scale, trailing only topaz, corundum (sapphires and rubies) and diamond. However, as a gemstone, citrine is relatively soft. It’s possible to cut and shape citrine into various configurations. Although citrine jewelry pieces scratch easily, they’re tough enough to resist breaking or chipping.</li><li><strong>Health benefits:&nbsp;</strong>Many people feel that wearing citrine jewelry contributes to better physical and mental health. The yellowish color projects warmth and stimulates the brain, promoting creativity, motivation and self-expression. It also wards off negative feelings like anxiety and depression.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is the Worth of Citrine?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The worth of a citrine piece largely depends on its color. In general, the darker deep red-orange color offers the highest value at around $30 per carat. The value typically diminishes as the shade lightens. Pale yellow products may only be worth about $10 per carat. Unlike diamonds and other gemstones, size has little impact on the price of citrine jewelry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-T02Y8/a-citrine-and-diamond-gold-cuff-attributed-to-suzanne-belperron\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/60253516-b0e2837820773fddfd4cfd939dea5a0ca853bc3d9550aa44b5ff1d18554e45b1-min-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11473\" width=\"384\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/60253516-b0e2837820773fddfd4cfd939dea5a0ca853bc3d9550aa44b5ff1d18554e45b1-min-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/60253516-b0e2837820773fddfd4cfd939dea5a0ca853bc3d9550aa44b5ff1d18554e45b1-min-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/60253516-b0e2837820773fddfd4cfd939dea5a0ca853bc3d9550aa44b5ff1d18554e45b1-min-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/60253516-b0e2837820773fddfd4cfd939dea5a0ca853bc3d9550aa44b5ff1d18554e45b1-min-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/60253516-b0e2837820773fddfd4cfd939dea5a0ca853bc3d9550aa44b5ff1d18554e45b1-min-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/60253516-b0e2837820773fddfd4cfd939dea5a0ca853bc3d9550aa44b5ff1d18554e45b1-min-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\"></a><figcaption>Citrine and Diamond Gold Cuff<br>Sold for $150,000</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Caring for Citrine Jewelry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular care helps preserve the beauty of a citrine ring, watch, bracelet, necklace or earrings.

Many people attribute good health, wealth and security to the gemstones they wear or use. Each month has at least one associated gem known as a birthstone. Read on to learn about March’s most popular birthstone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is the Birthstone for March?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aquamarine is the birthstone for March. This gemstone got its name because its bright blue color resembles clear ocean water. The name “aquamarine” comes from the Latin word for seawater, “aquamarina.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aquamarine is a part of the beryl mineral family, along with emerald and heliodor. Beryl gems are often flawless and transparent.&nbsp;This blue or cyan gemstone forms in igneous rocks and grows in giant six-sided crystals that can reach a foot in length.&nbsp;The gems can grow to impressive sizes, then be cut down and polished to resemble clean-cut stones.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-GE5UF/david-webb-multigemstone-necklace\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multicolor-necklace-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11519\" width=\"388\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multicolor-necklace-791x1024.jpg 791w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multicolor-necklace-232x300.jpg 232w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multicolor-necklace-768x994.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multicolor-necklace-1187x1536.jpg 1187w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multicolor-necklace-1583x2048.jpg 1583w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/multicolor-necklace-scaled.jpg 1978w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 388px) 100vw, 388px\"></a><figcaption>David Webb Multigemstone Necklace<br>Sold for $10,625</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>When Did Aquamarine First Appear?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first documented discovery of aquamarine was made in 1723 in the Siberian mountains. By the end of the 18th century, large deposits of aquamarine were exported from Russia and shipped to Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, aquamarine primarily comes from Brazil. You can also find this gemstone in Nigeria, Pakistan, Zambia, Mozambique and Madagascar.<br>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does Aquamarine Have a Meaning?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many meanings and symbols associated with aquamarine. In ancient times, the Greeks and Romans thought of aquamarine as the sailor’s gem. They believed this blue gem would protect sailors during storms while traveling across the ocean. Ancient cultures also thought aquamarine was a token of love between married couples. Now, it’s the official gemstone to celebrate a 19th wedding anniversary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aquamarine also symbolizes happiness and everlasting youth in the Sumerian, Egyptian and Hebrew cultures. Many people believe that aquamarine has physical and mental healing powers. Modern believers think that the gemstone helps with fluid retention, glandular disorders and maintaining eye health. It’s also thought that aquamarine has calming, soothing and cleansing powers, making it an ideal gemstone for meditation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-19Z40M/tony-duquette-aquamarine-and-cultured-pearl-cuff\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1226-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11523\" width=\"347\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1226-1.jpeg 880w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1226-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1226-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1226-1-768x768.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px\"></a><figcaption><br>Tony Duquette Aquamarine and Cultured Pearl Cuff<br>Sold for $17,500</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Aquamarine Valuable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aquamarine is a semi-precious stone, making it an affordable gem. Light blue stones are abundant, which makes lighter varieties of the stone inexpensive. However, there are instances when aquamarine is more valuable. Rich, dark blue aquamarine is rare, so gems of those shades are highly valuable and more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most famous pieces of aquamarine is the crystal Eleanor Roosevelt received as a gift from the Brazillian government in 1936. It weighs 1,298 carats and is the second-largest cut of aquamarine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other famous aquamarine gemstones include the British Queen Elizabeth’s aquamarine tiara that matches her aquamarine necklace and earrings. Another member of the royal family also has an aquamarine piece of jewelry. Prince Harry gave his late mother Princess Diana’s aquamarine cocktail ring to his wife, Meghan Markle, as a gift.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contact Fortuna Auction Today</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to learn more about aquamarine jewelry?

However, the aspects of the surrealism movement have also shown up in fashion.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/art-history/surrealism-history\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The surrealism movement began in 1917</a>&nbsp;with Georgio de Chirico’s paintings, but it’s most famous for Salvador Dali’s unique work. Many people immediately recognize Dali’s 1931 painting,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>The Persistence of Memory</em></a>, and its abstract portrayal of melting clocks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cartier Crash watch, designed by Jean-Jacques Cartier in the late 1960s, closely resembles Dali’s famous melting clocks, with a distorted, oblong shape. Many people believe Dali’s painting inspired the watch. However, Cartier did not intentionally design the Cartier Crash based on Dali’s paintings. This abstract piece of jewelry has a slightly different history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where Did It Originate?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Louis-Francois Cartier founded the Cartier brand in Paris in 1847. His sons Louis, Pierre and Jacques continued the business in Paris, New York and London during the 20th century, eventually dominating international watch and jewelry design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cartier Crash watch originated in Jean-Jacques Cartier’s boutique on London’s Bond Street, which remains the company’s flagship location. When the Cartier Crash debuted in 1967, Cartier produced it in limited quantities. Two different stories about the design’s inspiration have circulated since then, but both versions involve a blazing car accident.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One rumor about the jewelry’s origin is that an elderly woman brought a watch to the boutique for repair after the heat from a car accident deformed its dial and case. Another version speculates that Cartier designed the watch in memory of a Cartier executive who died in a car crash while wearing a Cartier Baignoire Allongée watch. As with the other story, heat from the car crash distorted the watch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the alleged accident and ensuing Cartier Crash design, the Baignoire Allongée watch was undeformed but had an oblong shape. Its French name translates to “oblong bathtub” in English. Some have even joked that you can obtain a Cartier Crash by placing a Baignoire Allongée near a fire to achieve the same shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from these speculations about the watch’s beginning, some people believe Dali’s paintings inspired the design. Its deformed shape closely resembles the iconic melted clocks. Despite all the theories about the watch’s design inspiration, the truth may be less exciting. Cartier’s granddaughter, Francesca Cartier Brickell, claims that Cartier’s inspiration for the design originated from his idea to pinch the ends of the oval shape to adapt it into something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/02-originate-1024x416.jpg\" alt=\"cartier origin\" class=\"wp-image-11719\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/02-originate-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/02-originate-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/02-originate-768x312.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/02-originate.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who Owned the Cartier Crash?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many well-known celebrities have owned the Cartier Crash. Famous people such as Kanye West, Mary Quant, Stewart Granger, Tommy Nutter and Tyler, the Creator have worn the watch. In 2021, Jay-Z wore the 2015 update of the Cartier Crash, which is a skeletonized version in titanium that displays the watch’s inner gears. Celebrity attention increases the jewelry’s price and demand, making it much more challenging for collectors to obtain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Is It So Special?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cartier Crash is so unique because of its abstract design. The watch’s asymmetric shape symbolizes creative freedom and non-conformism. In a way, its distorted design is a form of rebellion against the standard watch designs people were used to. It boldly defies expectations and doesn’t reflect any decade’s stylistic features, making it stand out with a timelessness other watches can’t compare to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The famous distorted case posed a challenge for Jaeger LeCoultre, who produced the manual movement of the Roman numeral dial. The watch has an intricate, complex movement custom-made to operate within its unique shape. It also has custom-printed Roman numerals that give the illusion of melting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cartier Crash also stands out because of its scarcity. Cartier only released a handful of the 1967 design. In 1991, Cartier Paris released a smaller, updated version of the watch and only produced 200 pieces. In 1993, they updated and rereleased it to celebrate the rue de la Paix store’s opening. However, this time it was in yellow gold, and only 13 pieces were available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The watch’s engineering and inner workings make the Cartier Crash one of a kind. Engineers had to solve the challenge of fitting tiny gears into a distorted case. This accomplishment established the Cartier brand as a leader in watchmaking. The watches were rare not for marketing purposes but because of the work it took to produce them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where Is It Today?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the Cartier company released 50 pieces of the Cartier Crash Radieuse, an even more artistic update to the original design. Cartier reopened its original boutique on London’s Bond Street in 2018. To celebrate the historic boutique’s reopening, the company remade and released an update of the original Cartier Crash design, the Cartier Crash Bond Street, at one watch per month. The company also released the diamond-set Cartier Crash in a limited amount of 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, only a tiny fraction of collectors sought the Cartier Crash, but today, it is much more popular. Original designs are selling at much higher prices, and updated ones are challenging to find due to increased attention and high demand. In December 2019, FORTUNA<sup>®</sup>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/record-breaking-cartier-crash-leads-fortunas-december-sales/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">auctioned the Cartier Crash for $81,250</a>, surpassing its $50,000 estimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/03-where-is-today-1024x416.jpg\" alt=\"cartier crash today\" class=\"wp-image-11720\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/03-where-is-today-1024x416.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/03-where-is-today-300x122.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/03-where-is-today-768x312.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/03-where-is-today.jpg 1422w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sell or Buy Cartier at an Upcoming FORTUNA®!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cartier Crash’s limited release, combined with its timeless design, has made it a high-demand collector’s item.

The Speedmaster began as a sport and racing timepiece in 1957 and quickly became a preferred option for military applications due to its split-second timing capabilities. Several astronauts who participated in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space programs wore them during their missions, including lunar landings, leading to the nickname of “moon watches.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is an Omega Speedmaster?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a chronographic watch, the Speedmaster combines the performance capabilities of a stopwatch and display watch. These watches enable the user to make quick calculations that require precise timing. The Omega Speedmaster line combines these and a host of other technologically advanced features with a luxury watch’s attractiveness, enabling the brand to flourish for more than 60 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Omega Speedmaster Variations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Omega has produced multiple Speedmaster versions over the years, many of which have become highly valued collectors’ items. Some of the more coveted Omega Speedmaster watch incarnations include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Omega Speedmaster Reduced:&nbsp;</strong>Although it’s not necessarily the top choice of collectors, the so-called “Marui” is among the rarest Speedmaster models. Omega produced less than 2,000 of these watches, which were scaled-down versions of the full-size Omega Professional line.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Speedmaster 125:&nbsp;</strong>Another relatively scarce Speedmaster model, the limited-edition 125 first hit the marketplace in 1973. The watch was one of the first to include automatic chronographic movement. Despite this unique feature, the 125 never caught on with many buyers, likely because of its bulky design. Still, with a worldwide production of only 2,000 units and a relatively low price, it can provide a solid value for Omega Speedmaster collectors.</li><li><strong>Apollo XVII Gold:&nbsp;</strong>Omega launched this Speedmaster watch in 2017 to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Apollo 17, the final moon landing mission executed by the pioneering Apollo space program. The timepiece features the engraved words “Tribute to Eugene Cernan,” the mission’s commander who passed away that year. With only 272 units in circulation, this gleaming gold watch is sure to become a collector’s item.</li><li><strong>Silver Snoopy Award:&nbsp;</strong>Another Apollo commemorative watch, Omega introduced the Silver Snoopy Award in 2015 to pay homage to the 45th anniversary of Apollo XIII, the near-disastrous mission that spawned the oft-repeated catchphrase, “Houston, we have a problem.” The watch was an instant success, as its 1,970 units sold out in a few hours. Its value has nearly tripled in the ensuing years, making it a much-desired target of Speedmaster collectors.</li><li><strong>Speedmaster ’57:&nbsp;</strong>This 60th-anniversary edition of the first Speedmaster appeals to collectors of vintage Speedmaster watches. It even includes an engraving of “Speedmaster” in the same font as the original. It also foregoes any indication of “Professional,” which didn’t make its appearance until 1964.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Buy or Sell an Omega Speedmaster Watch at FORTUNA®</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to <a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/\">purchase</a> or <a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/selling/\">sell vintage or high-value Speedmaster watches</a>, there’s no better place than FORTUNA.

Serious collectors appreciate the high quality and beautiful stones used in Van Cleef &amp; Arpels jewelry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is Van Cleef &amp; Arpels?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Estelle Arpels and Alfred Van Cleef married in 1895 in Paris, they formed more than just a love match. The joining of their families, both with deep roots in the precious stone trade, also marked a new chapter in Parisian jewelry. The Van Cleef &amp; Arpels company continues to thrive today, more than 100 years after its founding, as an exclusive jewelry and watch maker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Estelle Arpels’ father dealt in precious stones, while Alfred Van Cleef’s father was a diamond broker. Alfred joined his father-in-law and brothers-in-law to create a boutique called the Maison, which has maintained the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vancleefarpels.com/us/en/the-maison/timeline/origins.html\">same address in Paris since 1906</a>. The company designed many unique pieces in the early days, including Touch Wood jewelry that combined wood with precious stones and metals. It soon expanded to watches as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Cleef &amp; Arpels also became known for its exquisite crowns made for royalty around the world. Some of its most famous pieces include the crown of Queen Nazli of Egypt and one for&nbsp;Empress Farah Pahlavi in Iran. The latter crown uses stones from the Imperial treasury, and the stunning piece includes diamonds, rubies, emeralds and pearls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Can You Identify Van Cleef &amp; Arpels Pieces?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each piece of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels jewelry displays a unique serial number&nbsp;as well as a signature stamp, which appears in the same place depending on the piece.

Decorative hair combs and pins were popular, along with Christian cross pendants and personalized lockets. This period got its start when Prince Albert proposed marriage to Queen Victoria with a serpent-shaped,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/royal-engagement-rings-through-the-centuries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bejeweled engagement ring</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The golden serpent represented the Roman symbol for eternal love. It featured a diamond mouth, ruby eyes and a prominent emerald for Victoria’s birthstone. Engagement rings incorporating the bride’s birthstone became popular as a result.&nbsp;Since society valued modesty for women, high necklines and bonnets made necklaces and earrings unpopular. But rings were large, colorful and full of jewels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Grand Period&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grand period was a season of mourning. In Victorian times, mourning was a strict, lengthy process. When a family member or spouse passed away, the griever had to wear a full black wardrobe.&nbsp;As a result, an entire industry formed around producing mourning clothing and jewelry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the passing of Prince Albert in 1861, Queen Victoria’s wardrobe of mourning influenced fashion. The following Grand period included pieces of jet, onyx and black glass. Some pieces included human hair or a likeness of the deceased. Skulls and skeletons were also popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Aesthetic Period&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Attitudes lightened again during the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fashionhistory.fitnyc.edu/1890-1899/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Aesthetic period of the 1880s</a>. During this period, there was a renewed appreciation for handmade artwork, rather than manufactured. Jewelers focused on showcasing the visual appeal of gems. Wearing jewelry became less about flaunting wealth — pieces grew smaller and daintier. Women also preferred smaller pieces due to their increasingly active lifestyles. In general, the focus shifted to artistic craftsmanship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"398\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/common-pieces.jpg\" alt=\"common pieces\" class=\"wp-image-11677\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/common-pieces.jpg 1000w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/common-pieces-300x119.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/common-pieces-768x306.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are There Common Styles or Pieces?<br>&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each period came with “hot” items, appealing to a broad market. Since the three periods were so differentiated, it’s best to consider each on its own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Popular Romantic Period Pieces&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This period was all about expressing affection in close relationships. One popular way to do so was with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.langantiques.com/university/regard-ring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a “regard” ring</a>, spelled out with corresponding gemstones. For instance, a “regard” ring would have a row of gems in the order of ruby, emerald, garnet, amethyst, ruby and diamond. That way, the gems “spelled” the word “regard” across the ring. Other rings used gems to spell words such as “adore,” “dearest” and “forever.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Popular Grand Period Pieces</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most intriguing and distinct jewels from this period were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://4cs.gia.edu/en-us/blog/antique-victorian-era-mourning-jewelry/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pieces incorporating human hair</a>. Queen Victoria herself wore a locket of Prince Albert’s hair. Hair-woven pieces became a popular way to signify mourning. Whether they contained hair or gems, pieces tended to be large and heavy, representing the extravagance of the uber-wealthy. Of course, materials were often black in color to signify mourning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Popular Aesthetic Period Pieces</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Motifs during the Aesthetic period were nature-inspired, including owls, clovers, oak leaves and stars. Pieces tended to be smaller and daintier. Though industrial mass-production was available, many jewelry-enthusiasts preferred hand-worked and hand-stamped pieces. One popular trend was to include the Hebrew word “Mizpah” on jewelry, meaning “the Lord watches over us while we’re apart.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who Are Some of the Most Major Jewelry Influencers of the Period?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Queen Victoria herself set global trends. Fashion tended to represent the Queen’s eras of life and values — romance, mourning and turning toward a brighter future. The master jewelers of the time helped fortify the trends and produce pieces for consumption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most influential jewelers of the 19th century included&nbsp;Carlo Guiliano and Alessandro Castellani. Guiliano was a goldsmith who worked with several prominent London jewelers. Guiliano was an Italian and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.langantiques.com/university/giuliano/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">moved to London</a>&nbsp;with his family in 1860. Castellani, who was also Italian, worked alongside archeologists to recreate ancient jewelry styles. The two of them created many famous Victorian-era pieces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/129741625-661e1e2d41aa188c6ce598c3564d44f335f6fe57bb84b3de60623c99f44c958e-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11733\" width=\"440\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/129741625-661e1e2d41aa188c6ce598c3564d44f335f6fe57bb84b3de60623c99f44c958e-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/129741625-661e1e2d41aa188c6ce598c3564d44f335f6fe57bb84b3de60623c99f44c958e-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/129741625-661e1e2d41aa188c6ce598c3564d44f335f6fe57bb84b3de60623c99f44c958e-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/129741625-661e1e2d41aa188c6ce598c3564d44f335f6fe57bb84b3de60623c99f44c958e-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/129741625-661e1e2d41aa188c6ce598c3564d44f335f6fe57bb84b3de60623c99f44c958e-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/129741625-661e1e2d41aa188c6ce598c3564d44f335f6fe57bb84b3de60623c99f44c958e-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 440px) 100vw, 440px\"><figcaption>Victorian Diamond and Onyx Navette Ring<br>Sold for $5,625</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Can You Identify Victorian Jewelry?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because Victorian jewelry is so diverse, it can be tricky to identify. Certain clues may help you determine if a piece is Victorian. Evaluate these elements to decide whether or not you have a piece of Victorian jewelry:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Fittings and clasps.&nbsp;</li><li>Materials.&nbsp;</li><li>Motifs and symbols.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fittings and Clasps&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Jewelry made in the 19th century was limited to certain hardware — some clasp and fitting technologies were not invented until the 20th century. For instance, early brooch fasteners&nbsp;from around 1850 had a tube hinge and simple C-shaped catch. In the 1910s, safety catches emerged. If a brooch features a safety catch, it’s unlikely to be Victorian.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Materials&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Romantic period, gold dominated along with precious gems. Gold remained popular during the Grand period, along with darker materials like black enamel, jet and onyx to symbolize mourning. Newly discovered diamonds became a common element of Aesthetic period jewelry. To determine if a piece of jewelry is Victorian, evaluate whether or not its materials match the trends of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Motifs and Symbols&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dramatic changes in common symbols and motifs marked each period of the Victorian era.&nbsp;Note the main influences on each period:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Romantic:</strong>&nbsp;The Romantic period involved many references to ancient Greek and Roman mythology. You may find depictions of figures like Cupid or Aphrodite.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Grand:</strong>&nbsp;During the Grand period, bulky pieces might incorporate human hair or depictions of the dead, as well as symbols of skulls and skeletons. Archeological finds kept ancient influences popular.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Aesthetic:</strong>&nbsp;Pieces from the Aesthetic movement tended to be small and include nature-inspired imagery. Stars, moons, animals and leaves were common.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Buy or Sell Jewelry With FORTUNA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Antique jewelry pieces are physical relics of history — their value increases with their historical significance. The intrinsic worth of materials and craftsmanship is not the only factor that makes jewelry valuable. Jewelry tells age-old stories of love, grief and optimism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Determining the value of jewelry can be a tricky pursuit. Sellers often have no way of knowing whether or not valuations are fair, and buyers can fall victim to inflated prices. That’s why real-time, transparent auctions are so popular among jewelry traders.

Some months, like November, are associated with two gemstones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Is November’s Birthstone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>November is a month with two birthstones — the traditional November birthstone is topaz, while the modern gemstone for November is citrine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topaz is a gorgeous gem that comes in an array of colors. Golden or yellow topaz is most often associated with its status as a November birthstone, but other topaz colors include blue, pink, violet, orange and colorless. Topaz has a hardness of 8 but poor toughness, which means these gemstones require careful cleaning and handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citrine is the modern November birthstone. This gem comes in warm shades ranging from transparent yellow to a deep, orangey-brown similar to golden topaz. While citrine is slightly lower on the Mohs hardness scale than topaz, it has greater durability, making it more practical for everyday wear. Citrine is often easier to acquire and more affordable than topaz, qualities which have fueled its popularity as a November birthstone over the last several decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Origins of Topaz and Citrine</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Topaz is commonly found in&nbsp;Brazil, Pakistan, Namibia, Nigeria, Madagascar and parts of Russia. Historically, the gem has been popular among royalty, including the Russian monarchy, which mined the rare, golden-pink imperial topaz in the Ural Mountains. Ancient Greeks and Medieval Europeans believed topaz had special properties of strength and wisdom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Citrine has also been popular since antiquity and has a long history of being mistaken for golden topaz. Citrine is found all over the world, but top sources for this gemstone include Bolivia, Spain, Madagascar, Mexico and Uruguay. Many modern citrines are heat-treated amethysts from Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Do the November Birthstones Mean?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For centuries, people have associated birthstones with particular qualities and characteristics, and November’s gemstones are no exception. Topaz was important to ancient Greeks, Europeans during the Renaissance and Hindus in India for hundreds of years. Many cultures believed topaz provided strength, dispelled anger and ensured wisdom and beauty. During the Middle Ages, some people thought topaz could thwart magic spells. Topaz is also connected to health, healing and long life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, cultures around the world believed citrine could soothe tempers and promote calm. From the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans to Scots during the Victorian Era, citrine has been a popular jewelry choice for centuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blue topaz is the traditional fourth wedding anniversary gift, and imperial topaz is for the 23rd anniversary. Citrine is often given as a 13th wedding anniversary present.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are Topaz and Citrine Valuable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The value of November’s birthstones depends on a number of factors including color, size, condition and origins. In recent decades, the market has seen an increase in heat-treated topazes and citrines, which has made both gemstones more abundant and affordable. Famous pieces of topaz jewelry are highly valuable due to their hue, history and natural origins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learn More About Yellow Gemstones</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about November’s two warm and radiant gemstones,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/contact-us/\">contact Fortuna Auction today</a>.

In the late 1960s, Rolex introduced the 1680 reference with a date complication, catering to its evolving status as a cultural symbol. Rolex produced the watch with the “SUBMARINER” text written in a bright red hue for just a short period of time. In the years since, many of these watches had their dials replaced during servicing. It’s this short production run combined with a penchant for dial replacements during servicing that makes the “Red Sub” one of the most sought-after Submariners in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-7BO3E8/rolex-submariner-1680-red-in-steel-with-box-and-papers-from-original-owner\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/208799486-62f9d10f146aef5591131099effbd23369940bb55228da7754e93f1f4ad5f8e8-1024x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12944\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/208799486-62f9d10f146aef5591131099effbd23369940bb55228da7754e93f1f4ad5f8e8-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/208799486-62f9d10f146aef5591131099effbd23369940bb55228da7754e93f1f4ad5f8e8-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/208799486-62f9d10f146aef5591131099effbd23369940bb55228da7754e93f1f4ad5f8e8-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/208799486-62f9d10f146aef5591131099effbd23369940bb55228da7754e93f1f4ad5f8e8-768x768.jpeg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/208799486-62f9d10f146aef5591131099effbd23369940bb55228da7754e93f1f4ad5f8e8-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/208799486-62f9d10f146aef5591131099effbd23369940bb55228da7754e93f1f4ad5f8e8-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-207bea06-04eb-434a-a525-140b07477bf4\">While the Rolex “Red Sub” is undoubtedly rare and desirable, the condition of the example significantly impacts its value.

As a revered timepiece, the Coke has left its mark on popular culture and established itself as a staple in the world of horology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-42455d4e-a2dc-4715-b94b-ac319d524984\">The Rolex GMT Master II “Coke” was introduced in 1983 as the successor to the original GMT Master, which made its debut in 1954. Developed in collaboration with Pan American Airways, the GMT Master was designed for pilots who required a watch capable of tracking multiple time zones simultaneously. The GMT Master II “Coke” (Reference 16760) built upon this functionality, boasting an independent 24-hour hand and a bi-directional bezel that allowed wearers to track three separate time zones.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://auctions.fortunaauction.com/lots/view/1-7BRR89/rolex-gmt-master-ii-coke-in-steel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/204917332-dccce379fb9aa472bdc01405b4854baf80da3b9a828f9d5b25211cc7fd6b8b9f-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13057\" srcset=\"https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/204917332-dccce379fb9aa472bdc01405b4854baf80da3b9a828f9d5b25211cc7fd6b8b9f-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/204917332-dccce379fb9aa472bdc01405b4854baf80da3b9a828f9d5b25211cc7fd6b8b9f-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/204917332-dccce379fb9aa472bdc01405b4854baf80da3b9a828f9d5b25211cc7fd6b8b9f-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/204917332-dccce379fb9aa472bdc01405b4854baf80da3b9a828f9d5b25211cc7fd6b8b9f-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/204917332-dccce379fb9aa472bdc01405b4854baf80da3b9a828f9d5b25211cc7fd6b8b9f-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.fortunaauction.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/204917332-dccce379fb9aa472bdc01405b4854baf80da3b9a828f9d5b25211cc7fd6b8b9f-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-207bea06-04eb-434a-a525-140b07477bf4\">The nickname “Coke” stems from the watch’s distinctive red and black bezel, reminiscent of the Coca-Cola company’s iconic colors.

The red and black segments differentiate between day and night hours, enabling wearers to track time zones more intuitively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-207bea06-04eb-434a-a525-140b07477bf4\">Over the years, the Rolex GMT Master II “Coke” has become a popular choice among celebrities and high-profile figures, further cementing its status as a cultural icon.
