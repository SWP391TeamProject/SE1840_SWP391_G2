Its passionate red colour makes ruby an ideal choice for a romantic gift that comes with a rich legacy.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Feel free to “make an offer” on our other items :)</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>We Accept Payments through</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>PayPal</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Direct Deposit</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Credit Cards</strong><em><br></em></p></li></ul><p><strong><em>When you receive, your items don’t forget to give us feedback because you and your words are more precious than gemstone in case you dislike, or you have any problem with our item before leaving negative or neutral feedback give us a chance to resolve your problem a little bit difference of weight and measurements can be due to different measurements scales.</em></strong></p>","reservePrice":712409,"buyInPrice":25646724,"status":"IN_AUCTION","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/175000-179999/178890/efef2599-aec8-4ba2-92aa-46d8e641bd21.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/175000-179999/178890/97563421-f77b-4c27-ad67-7b9e3d63565a.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/175000-179999/178890/88cd4e30-71b1-4ce3-8d1c-2baca2471c81.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/175000-179999/178890/3a5f5f7d-0c5d-42af-8cea-fd66f96b7e42.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2023-05-13T04:45:35.273Z","updateDate":"2023-05-13T04:45:35.273Z","ownerId":25},{"id":63,"categoryId":1,"name":"34.85 cts Amethyst Silver Ring SJ-1475 simplyjewelery","description":"<h1><strong><br>AMETHYST RING</strong></h1><p></p><p><strong>925 SILVER </strong></p><p><strong>BEAUTIFUL OVAL STONE </strong></p><p><strong>NICE PURPLE COLOUR</strong></p><p><br></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>TRADING AS- TRUEBLUEOPALS PTY LTD/ LIGHTNINGOPALS LLC</strong></p>","reservePrice":689188,"buyInPrice":53756664,"status":"IN_AUCTION","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/170000-174999/170702/20742fbc-5464-4615-b9c4-642011d445d6.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/170000-174999/170702/1fab9276-76b1-42fc-b543-9288ebf7921a.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/170000-174999/170702/bb43223b-a529-4989-96e7-f768e25c96e4.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/170000-174999/170702/3cb1732e-f7d3-4d4e-8872-c0d4d8315d0d.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2024-04-16T16:15:23.274Z","updateDate":"2024-04-16T16:15:23.274Z","ownerId":38},{"id":64,"categoryId":1,"name":"37.1 CTS SAPPHIRE SILVER RING SJ-1478 simplyjewelery","description":"<h1>BLUE SAPPHIRE RING&nbsp;</h1><p></p><p><strong>STAMPED 925 STERLING SILVER</strong></p><p><strong>BEAUTIFUL BLUE SAPPHIRES </strong></p><p><strong>WITH WHITE QUARTZ STONES </strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>TRADING AS TRUEBLUEOPALS / LIGHTINGOPALS LLC</strong></p><p></p><p><br></p>","reservePrice":218123,"buyInPrice":10033658,"status":"IN_AUCTION","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/170000-174999/170705/621c6499-3408-460b-be6c-96bd7c1fd99d.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/170000-174999/170705/113b423e-fbd2-40cd-b30a-8435919bb2ab.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/170000-174999/170705/d3dac82b-60df-4552-8f2f-98e3c0e289ac.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/170000-174999/170705/4b39bd2b-abd5-4d84-ba48-a0708d3b4018.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2024-04-18T04:57:27.274Z","updateDate":"2024-04-18T04:57:27.274Z","ownerId":38},{"id":65,"categoryId":1,"name":"Stunning Design glass-Filled Sapphire Ring sterling silver 925","description":"<p><strong><em>DESCRIPTION:<br></em></strong><br><br><strong>September’s birthstone has come a long way since the days when any and every blue stone was called a sapphire.

(The island never produced topaz, but it was once a source of peridot, which was confused with topaz before the development of modern mineralogy.) Some scholars trace the origin back to Sanskrit (an ancient language of India) and the word topas or tapaz, meaning “fire.”<br><br>The ancient Greeks believed that topaz gave them strength. In Europe during the Renaissance (the period from the 1300s to the 1600s) people thought that topaz could break magic spells and dispel anger. For centuries, many people in India have believed that topaz worn above the heart assures long life, beauty, and intelligence.<br><br>The name for imperial topaz originated in nineteenth-century Russia. At the time, the Ural Mountains were topaz’s leading source, and the pink gemstone mined there was named to honor the Russian czar. Ownership of the gem was restricted to the royal family.<br><br>Today, topaz is one of the US birthstones for November.

It's of a nice bright Orange colour with no perceivable hint of brown as can often be found. I can't see any indications of treatment.

This claw set style of ring is timeless, they have been around for many years and always seem to be in fashion. I made this one in Platinum as I think the white goes well with the Emerald. Also, if it was in gold, my wife might want to keep it!</p><p></p><p>Three stone rings are one of the all time classics as a coloured stone ring goes. This one is a nice example with a good, strong colour Emerald and two, nice, bright Diamonds.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ring Size:</strong> UK Size K, US Size 5.25, EU 49 5/8, De 16.</p><p><strong>Emerald Weight and Cut:</strong> Square Emerald cut, approximately 0.75 cts of a rich green colour. Believed to be Zambian, but no origin report to confirm this. The Emerald has minor oiling for clarity enhancement, which is a common and traditional treatment for Emeralds.</p><p><strong>Diamond Weight and Cut: </strong>2x Natural Round Brilliant cuts, approximately 0.34cts in total, G/H SI (with no black marks), approximately 3.5mm in diameter.</p><p><strong>Marks/Metal:</strong> The ring has a full UK hallmark for Platinum (950).</p><p><strong>Condition: </strong>Excellent, it's fresh off the bench.</p><p><strong>Sizing:</strong> It is possible to size this, but please ask first, so we can make sure it's possible and what cost/timescale may be involved.</p><p></p><p>The Emerald measures approximately 5.5 mm x 5.25 mm. It's of a nice strong green reminiscent of Colombian colour, but has more of the characteristics of a Zambian stone under the microscope, but this is just my opinion and not guaranteed to be either origin. The stone is transparent and has many inclusion as is expected with Emeralds. If you ever have the opportunity to look at an Emerald under a microscope, please do, they are fascinating.</p><p></p><p>The setting measures approximately 11.5 mm across the finger and x 6 mm at the widest point. The setting stands approximately 6.3 mm high off the finger. The shank/band is a relatively uniform 2 mm thick tapering towards the setting.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A quick note if you're thinking of this as an engagement ring. Please don't buy it. I'm an \"Old School\" jeweller who cares about his pieces once they've found a new home. Emeralds are a little softer and more brittle than the traditional engagement stones such as Diamonds, Sapphire and Rubies. If worn everyday, as engagement rings tend to be, it will suffer over time. I want you to look after this and enjoy it for many years to come.</p><p></p><p>The Diamond and Gemstone gradings in this listing are my own opinion and not backed up by a report. These gradings are based on many years’ experience dealing in Diamonds and Gemstones along side the training I have received and qualifications I hold (such as GIA’s Diamond Diploma). These opinions are offered as honestly as possible. Unless otherwise stated, the gradings are assessed whilst the stones are mounted. This can cause restrictions in what is possible to see.</p><p></p><p>For international orders, all applicable import, duty and tax fees are the responsibility of the buyer.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for looking and please have a look around my shops.
