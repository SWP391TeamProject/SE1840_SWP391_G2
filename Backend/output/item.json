But they don’t show the same ‘fire’ you may initially think of as being characteristic of opals. Generally, pink opals are opaque and a baby pink, coral, blush, or cream color and are known for diverse, vibrant hues in several varieties, the most valuable variety being pale pink opals. The most coveted pale pink opals are sometimes lovingly referred to as the ‘peppermint candy stone.’</strong></p><p><strong>Most pink opals come from Peru, though they can be found in other South American countries, the United States, and Australia. They are mined and polished as other gemstones and diamonds are. They make excellent necklaces, rings, earrings, and are often considered to have healing properties.</strong></p><p><strong>Pink opals are popular because of their beauty, symbolism, and variation. Read on to learn everything you need to know about these stunning pink gems.</strong></p><h2><strong>What Are Pink Opals?</strong></h2><p><strong>Pink opals are a natural type of gemstone that contain palygorskite and chalcedony. Palygorskite is a phyllosilicate that resembles opal, while white chalcedony is a microcrystalline quartz mineral. These opals are also composed of hydrated silica and have a water content that makes up 6-10% of the gem. Iron and aluminum contribute to their natural radiance. And they have higher contents of iron than other opals, which is the component that gives them their distinctive pinkness that can range from bubblegum to a subtly pinky-white.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>10mm 12mm available.</strong></p>","reservePrice":859358,"buyInPrice":22343308,"status":"IN_AUCTION","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/193004/051352a7-1d89-435e-a455-6a71733fe2d2.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/193004/f9f8a910-14c8-4fa7-b89e-8945dd72acbf.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/193004/25f5b92c-e675-4692-9592-0aff12e67635.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/193004/9c2bd0f5-2649-45e2-be38-01133c050769.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2023-02-01T15:23:20.956Z","updateDate":"2023-02-01T15:23:20.956Z","ownerId":16},{"id":46,"categoryId":5,"name":"Natural Ethiopian Opal Earring, 925 Sterling Silver Earring, Opal Earring","description":"<p>Stone Name - Natural Ethiopian Opal<br><br>Stone Size - 5x7 MM<br><br>Stone Shape - Oval </p><p></p><p>Cut - Smooth <br><br>Quality - AAA to AAAA<br><br>Metal - 925 Sterling Silver<br><br>Silver Weight - 1.5 to 2 Gram Approximate</p><p></p><p>Payment Policy<br>************************<br><br>We accept payment through PayPal Payment should be made within 3 days of purchase.<br><br><br><br>Delivery Time<br>*************************<br><br>It is Handmade Item So Item will be Shipped within 1 to 3 Days after payment receive.<br><br>The delivery time usually takes 11 to 24 days, depending which Country &amp; location.<br><br><br>We recommend you contact your local customs office if you have questions about this.<br><br><br>Feedback<br>**************************<br><br>If you are not satisfied with your purchased items then contact with us first before leaving negative or neutral feedback or opening disputes.

Baltic amber, prized for its range of colors and inclusion of well-preserved flora and fauna from ancient times, is highly valued in jewelry making, ornamental crafts, and scientific research due to its historical and aesthetic significance.</p>","reservePrice":55459,"buyInPrice":4880392,"status":"IN_AUCTION","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/185000-189999/187424/aea58715-c59e-476f-92f7-d7dcdaabf7b5.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/185000-189999/187424/ff3bd9b0-f236-407c-8099-81ed6174796a.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/185000-189999/187424/4ed5e137-cc49-4f3e-bd96-1a4a263b6227.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/185000-189999/187424/bf527e88-f414-4a30-868e-8d02f2d51cf7.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2023-10-24T00:38:44.962Z","updateDate":"2023-10-24T00:38:44.962Z","ownerId":42},{"id":57,"categoryId":3,"name":"5.05 Cts Ruby Topaz Silver Pendant RNJ-27 RANIJEWELRY","description":"<h1>Ruby White Topaz Pendant</h1><h1>Africa</h1><p></p><p><strong>Ruby Glass filled</strong></p><p><strong>925 Silver</strong></p><p><strong>Ready to wear</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>PARENT COMPANIES: TRUEBLUEOPALS PTY LTD (AUSTRALIA ) AND LIGHTNINGOPAL LLC (USA)</strong></p><p></p><p></p>","reservePrice":821682,"buyInPrice":47657556,"status":"IN_AUCTION","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/199941/8654e52f-aa68-4571-93e0-419b8f049395.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/199941/02b09055-1239-4f9d-81d1-9217819866c3.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2022-06-18T08:56:31.960Z","updateDate":"2022-06-18T08:56:31.960Z","ownerId":32},{"id":58,"categoryId":1,"name":"Boulder opal in platinum with diamonds","description":"<p>BOULDER OPAL</p><p>This is a natural boulder opal set in platinum and stamped pt900.</p><p>The weight and size below is for the opal</p><p>The diamonds are eye clean bright commercial diamonds and the total weight is 1.02 cts</p><p></p>","reservePrice":296819,"buyInPrice":11872760,"status":"IN_AUCTION","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/160000-164999/160618/29144eb6-c3ed-476c-9a7f-381b4b2989c9.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/160000-164999/160618/daf7d4bb-c68d-4424-b3b9-aee6c4f5c637.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/160000-164999/160618/59d23f37-b2db-49b9-a622-9ef76cb8d8cf.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/160000-164999/160618/c2b751e3-b8dc-4fad-8b64-2109fb06ca6b.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2022-10-03T22:57:57.958Z","updateDate":"2022-10-03T22:57:57.958Z","ownerId":23},{"id":59,"categoryId":2,"name":"Enchanted Siren Mermaid Necklace","description":"<p>Dive into the mystical allure of the ocean with our Enchanted Siren Mermaid Necklace.

Since antiquity, emerald’s rich “green fire” has symbolized eternal spring and immortality.

However, jasper, in addition to  or silica, contains an unusually large amount of impurities, mainly iron oxide. It is fine-grained and often strongly marked with orbicular or striped patterns. Red jasper is the most popular gemstone. Yellow, green, and brown colors also exist. These colors may be patchy in nature, several SiO2 of them maybe present in the same stone, and they may fade into each other. Iron combinations is the coloring agent for jasper gemstones.For instance iron oxide is responsible for the red color and oxidized ferric iron (ferrous iron) is responsible for green color. Jasper frequently show a well-developed banding. The bands may range from about one tenth of an inch to one inch in thickness. They are straight and parallel rather than concentric (opposite to banded agates). The name jasper is derived from the Greek word for spotted or speckled stone (in another source it is believed that the name jasper is derived from the ancient word iaspis). Green with red spots jasper is the traditional birthstone of March.</em></strong></p><p></p>","reservePrice":24852,"buyInPrice":1292304,"status":"QUEUE","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/202017/cd138ea9-1c26-4ed7-a657-eb89115d4343.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/202017/b8d69e07-e0b9-44b9-a497-6214865172df.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/202017/79b5d8a8-0c06-4749-9391-333920730f64.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/202017/da14c705-3682-45d8-a78b-de4f3f3ad9f5.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2023-06-03T12:24:49.957Z","updateDate":"2023-06-03T12:24:49.957Z","ownerId":19},{"id":342,"categoryId":1,"name":"Natural Citrine Ring, 925 Sterling Silver with Rhodium plating","description":"<p>Center Gemstone : Natural Citrine<br>Gemstone Weight : 1 Carat Approx.<br>Access stone : Cubic zirconia<br>Material : Natural Gemstone<br>Gemstone Creation : Natural<br>Gemstone Size : 6x8 mm<br>Gemstone Shape : Emerald cut<br>Metal : Silver<br>Metal : 925 Sterling Silver with rhodium Plating.<br><br>This ring features 6x8 mm emerald cut Natural Citrine and 925 sterling silver finished with rhodium Plating.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Note : We offer different ring sizes from US 3 to US 13 size.</p>","reservePrice":355407,"buyInPrice":13150059,"status":"QUEUE","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/200712/b3042642-689a-4a92-976e-c6820fdfdedf.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/200712/8e387281-8dfe-42fc-bd92-a608de0e3b54.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2021-09-30T00:23:56.960Z","updateDate":"2021-09-30T00:23:56.960Z","ownerId":33},{"id":343,"categoryId":3,"name":"Pleasing , Natural Raw Tourmaline Pendant","description":"<p><strong>Item Name : Natural Raw Tourmaline Pendant</strong></p><p><strong>Gemstone used : Natural Raw Tourmaline </strong></p><p><strong>Metal : Rhodium Plated</strong></p>","reservePrice":255212,"buyInPrice":2807332,"status":"QUEUE","imageURLs":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/198143/21adb9cf-517e-4adb-a94e-36d69aa3c058.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/198143/7b917045-ee7e-4104-afe5-632d740df5ed.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/198143/7e9fe1ee-8a50-4add-a532-0be50ac3f7e4.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2024-01-14T13:15:54.957Z","updateDate":"2024-01-14T13:15:54.957Z","ownerId":22},{"id":344,"categoryId":1,"name":"Whispering Leaves Open Wrap Ring","description":"<p>Grace your finger with the Whispering Leaves Open Wrap Ring, a delicate creation that celebrates nature's effortless beauty.

This piece is one where a little more care was taken in the design and construction than many others as the setting are in white gold and the shank is yellow gold.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ring Size:</strong> UK Size M, US Size 6.25, EU 52 1/8, DE 16 3/4.</p><p></p><p><strong>Natural Spessartine Garnet Weight and Cut:</strong> Oval, approximately 2.52 cts of a nice, bright Mandarin Orange colour.

It's of a nice bright Orange colour with no perceivable hint of brown as can often be found. I can't see any indications of treatment.
