(The island never produced topaz, but it was once a source of peridot, which was confused with topaz before the development of modern mineralogy.) Some scholars trace the origin back to Sanskrit (an ancient language of India) and the word topas or tapaz, meaning “fire.”<br><br>The ancient Greeks believed that topaz gave them strength. In Europe during the Renaissance (the period from the 1300s to the 1600s) people thought that topaz could break magic spells and dispel anger. For centuries, many people in India have believed that topaz worn above the heart assures long life, beauty, and intelligence.<br><br>The name for imperial topaz originated in nineteenth-century Russia.

This claw set style of ring is timeless, they have been around for many years and always seem to be in fashion. I made this one in Platinum as I think the white goes well with the Emerald. Also, if it was in gold, my wife might want to keep it!</p><p></p><p>Three stone rings are one of the all time classics as a coloured stone ring goes. This one is a nice example with a good, strong colour Emerald and two, nice, bright Diamonds.</p><p></p><p><strong>Ring Size:</strong> UK Size K, US Size 5.25, EU 49 5/8, De 16.</p><p><strong>Emerald Weight and Cut:</strong> Square Emerald cut, approximately 0.75 cts of a rich green colour. Believed to be Zambian, but no origin report to confirm this. The Emerald has minor oiling for clarity enhancement, which is a common and traditional treatment for Emeralds.</p><p><strong>Diamond Weight and Cut: </strong>2x Natural Round Brilliant cuts, approximately 0.34cts in total, G/H SI (with no black marks), approximately 3.5mm in diameter.</p><p><strong>Marks/Metal:</strong> The ring has a full UK hallmark for Platinum (950).</p><p><strong>Condition: </strong>Excellent, it's fresh off the bench.</p><p><strong>Sizing:</strong> It is possible to size this, but please ask first, so we can make sure it's possible and what cost/timescale may be involved.</p><p></p><p>The Emerald measures approximately 5.5 mm x 5.25 mm. It's of a nice strong green reminiscent of Colombian colour, but has more of the characteristics of a Zambian stone under the microscope, but this is just my opinion and not guaranteed to be either origin. The stone is transparent and has many inclusion as is expected with Emeralds. If you ever have the opportunity to look at an Emerald under a microscope, please do, they are fascinating.</p><p></p><p>The setting measures approximately 11.5 mm across the finger and x 6 mm at the widest point. The setting stands approximately 6.3 mm high off the finger. The shank/band is a relatively uniform 2 mm thick tapering towards the setting.</p><p></p><p></p><p>A quick note if you're thinking of this as an engagement ring. Please don't buy it. I'm an \"Old School\" jeweller who cares about his pieces once they've found a new home. Emeralds are a little softer and more brittle than the traditional engagement stones such as Diamonds, Sapphire and Rubies. If worn everyday, as engagement rings tend to be, it will suffer over time. I want you to look after this and enjoy it for many years to come.</p><p></p><p>The Diamond and Gemstone gradings in this listing are my own opinion and not backed up by a report. These gradings are based on many years’ experience dealing in Diamonds and Gemstones along side the training I have received and qualifications I hold (such as GIA’s Diamond Diploma). These opinions are offered as honestly as possible. Unless otherwise stated, the gradings are assessed whilst the stones are mounted.

(The island never produced topaz, but it was once a source of peridot, which was confused with topaz before the development of modern mineralogy.) Some scholars trace the origin back to Sanskrit (an ancient language of India) and the word topas or tapaz, meaning “fire.”<br><br>The ancient Greeks believed that topaz gave them strength. In Europe during the Renaissance (the period from the 1300s to the 1600s) people thought that topaz could break magic spells and dispel anger. For centuries, many people in India have believed that topaz worn above the heart assures long life, beauty, and intelligence.<br><br>The name for imperial topaz originated in nineteenth-century Russia. At the time, the Ural Mountains were topaz’s leading source, and the pink gemstone mined there was named to honor the Russian czar. Ownership of the gem was restricted to the royal family.<br><br>Today, topaz is one of the US birthstones for November.

The beautiful green hues of this beryl variety, combined with its rarity, make it one of the world’s most valuable gemstones.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Feel free to “make an offer” on our other items :)</strong></p><p><strong>We Accept Payment through</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>PayPal</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Direct Deposit</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Credit Card</strong></p></li></ul><p></p><p><strong><em>When you receive, your items don’t forget to give us feedback because you and your words are more precious than gemstone .in case you dislike, or you have any problem with our item before leaving negative or neutral feedback give us a chance to resolve your problem a little bit difference of weight and measurements can be due to different measurements scales</em></strong>.</p>","price":566105,"imageUrls":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/197867/94d6c182-f74b-491f-98b5-930ba0a8c093.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/197867/b4922b21-5eff-4a66-b639-beb6a8832a65.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/197867/489bb5b2-b603-4dec-92eb-e16d791d608b.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/195000-199999/197867/f556ffe0-392c-4c5b-b1a9-e562fde5a375.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2021-12-14T13:20:30.709Z","updateDate":"2021-12-14T13:20:30.709Z"},{"consignmentId":298,"id":590,"__name":"495.5 Tcw.

However, Muzo emeralds tend to be shorter than those from Chivor. Muzo emerald crystals tend to have a more saturated colour.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Geologically speaking, Colombian emeralds are said to be the purest emeralds in the world because Colombian emerald deposits are the only ones on earth found in sedimentary host rock rather than in Igneous rock. The tectonic movements that created the Andes Mountains force the raw materials of emeralds—beryllium, chromium, and vanadium—found in the ground into liquid and gaseous states. These materials, in such states, find their way into cracks in the already sedimentary medium surrounding them and then eventually cool and crystallize. A saline solution found in the sedimentary rock eventually washes out impurities such as iron that cloud other beryls from forming onto the crystallizing stone. This intricate process produces the emeralds found in the mines of Colombia.</strong></p><p><strong>An emerald is actually a beryllium stone that owes its special color to beryllium, chromium, and vanadium, all of which are chemical elements that are very scarce, and the reason for the color of an emerald. Colombian emeralds are much sought after, and not just because of their superb quality and color. A gem's value depends upon its size, purity, color and brilliance. Even when they are mined in the same area, each individual emerald has its own unique look that sets it apart from the rest. Dark green is considered to be the most beautiful, scarce, and valuable color for emeralds. An emerald of this color is considered rare and is only found in the deepest mines of Colombia.</strong></p><p><strong><br>Please do not hesitate to send offers and we'll try to get a deal.<br><br>Worldwide Insured Shipping<br><br>100% refund returns Policy<br>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>SALES POLICY<br></strong></p><p><strong>We offer 30 days full refund and return policy for all buyers.

They have three-phase inclusions containing gas, fluid and crystals of halite together with pyrite and albite.</strong></p><p><strong>Matrix characteristics of Chivor emeralds</strong></p><p><strong>In the matrix of Chivor emeralds greyish shale is combined with grey calcite and layers of iron oxide and crystallised knots of pyrite. The matrix is fragile and has brown stains caused by iron oxide. Because of this fragility, fewer specimens with the matrix still intact are found in Chivor.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>Geologically speaking, Colombian emeralds are said to be the purest emeralds in the world because Colombian emerald deposits are the only ones on earth found in sedimentary host rock rather than in Igneous rock. The tectonic movements that created the Andes Mountains force the raw materials of emeralds—beryllium, chromium, and vanadium—found in the ground into liquid and gaseous states. These materials, in such states, find their way into cracks in the already sedimentary medium surrounding them and then eventually cool and crystallize. A saline solution found in the sedimentary rock eventually washes out impurities such as iron that cloud other beryls from forming onto the crystallizing stone. This intricate process produces the emeralds found in the mines of Colombia.</strong></p><p><strong>An emerald is actually a beryllium stone that owes its special color to beryllium, chromium, and vanadium, all of which are chemical elements that are very scarce, and the reason for the color of an emerald. Colombian emeralds are much sought after, and not just because of their superb quality and color. A gem's value depends upon its size, purity, color and brilliance. Even when they are mined in the same area, each individual emerald has its own unique look that sets it apart from the rest. Dark green is considered to be the most beautiful, scarce, and valuable color for emeralds. An emerald of this color is considered rare and is only found in the deepest mines of Colombia.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>.<br>Please do not hesitate to send offers and we'll try to get a deal.<br><br>Worldwide Insured Shipping<br><br>100% refund returns Policy<br>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>SALES POLICY<br></strong></p><p><strong>We offer 30 days full refund and return policy for all buyers.

weighs approximately 5.67 cts and is set in a 9ct yellow gold setting. The White Topaz measures approximately 10 mm x 7mm, but I forgot to weigh it. The Topaz is set in a 9ct white gold setting.

Palygorskite is a phyllosilicate that resembles opal, while white chalcedony is a microcrystalline quartz mineral. These opals are also composed of hydrated silica and have a water content that makes up 6-10% of the gem. Iron and aluminum contribute to their natural radiance. And they have higher contents of iron than other opals, which is the component that gives them their distinctive pinkness that can range from bubblegum to a subtly pinky-white.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>10mm 12mm

Tiger's Eye or \"the Blue Tiger's Eye crystal\" is a beautiful soothing stone formed through a natural process that takes place deep within the Earth. The formation of this gemstone begins with the mineral Crocidolite, a type of asbestos. Over time, this mineral is subject to intense heat and pressure, causing it to change and morph into the stone we know as Blue Tiger's Eye.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>This transformation process is known as metamorphism, a vital step in forming many different types of stones. During metamorphism, the minerals that make up the Crocidolite are rearranged and reorganized, creating new structures and properties. In the case of Blue Tiger's Eye, this process causes the Crocidolite to become fibrous and take on a bluish-gray color.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The next step in forming this variety of Tiger's Eye is the process of alteration. The stone is exposed to fluids containing silicon and iron during alteration. These fluids work to replace the asbestos fibers in the Crocidolite with silicon and iron, creating the gemstone's unique chatoyancy, or \"cat's eye\" effect. The silicon and iron also give Blue Tiger's Eye its characteristic dreamy blue/gray/golden brown color.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The final step in the formation of Tiger's Eye is the process of weathering and erosion. Over time, the gemstone is exposed to the elements, and the outer layers of the stone begin to wear away. This process can take millions of years, giving Tiger's Eye its unique shape and texture.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>It's good to note that Blue Tiger's Eye is not a common stone and the quality of Tiger's Eye can vary greatly based on locale, with some of the best quality stones being found in mines in South Africa.</em></strong></p>","price":538258,"imageUrls":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/203203/175d8156-fa4c-48d4-b4fd-3371f848e1ce.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/203203/e1288320-63e6-48eb-9698-ce62c5360402.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/200000-204999/203203/b37affae-061d-43a8-84c8-1e272fc93574.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2022-09-02T04:47:48.709Z","updateDate":"2022-09-02T04:47:48.709Z"},{"consignmentId":696,"id":1380,"__name":"6mm 66.05CT Natural Lapis Lazuli Stretchable Bracelet.","status":"FINISHED","description":"<p><strong>66.05CT Natural Lapis Lazuli Stretchable Bracelet.</strong></p><p><strong>Weight:(66.05)CT </strong></p><p><strong>Size:(6mm)</strong></p><p><strong>Stone:(Lapis Lazuli)</strong></p><p><strong>Per Piece 20$</strong></p><p><strong>100 Pieces available</strong></p><p><strong>6mm 8mm 10mm 12mm available</strong></p>","price":713677,"imageUrls":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/194273/4556bfaa-ba1d-4ced-8cb2-5c11caff2e61.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/194273/06a9c65b-a53a-4c2d-bc5c-48830cf7e17e.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/194273/1f7857f4-7d42-4bbb-b423-7ebcc20e3e12.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/194273/d2985aa8-11f0-4b2b-8e72-ca0cbb378459.jpeg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2022-01-13T11:41:26.675Z","updateDate":"2022-01-13T11:41:26.675Z"},{"consignmentId":696,"id":1381,"__name":"10mm 195.60CT Natural Malachite stretchable Bracelet.","status":"FINISHED","description":"<p><strong>So Beautiful Natural Malachite Stretchable Bracelet.</strong></p><p><strong>Size:(10mm)</strong></p><p><strong>Weight:(195.60)carats.</strong></p><p><strong>100 Pieces available for sale.</strong></p><p><strong>Per Piece 20$</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Malachite is a mineral of copper and nowadays most of the available material comes out of copper mines.

It was named this because malachite had the same colors as the leaves of the mallow plant. Malachite is often found mixed with Eilat stone, chrysocolla, and azurite. Malachite is believed to be the result of aging copper ores. The green patina we see on weathered copper roofs is a form of malachite. Malachite works extremely well with all other crystals. The beautiful bands of green make malachite a visually appealing sacred stone. Malachite with concentric rings is somewhat rare and highly prized.

Red jasper is the most popular gemstone. Yellow, green, and brown colors also exist. These colors may be patchy in nature, several SiO2 of them maybe present in the same stone, and they may fade into each other. Iron combinations is the coloring agent for jasper gemstones.For instance iron oxide is responsible for the red color and oxidized ferric iron (ferrous iron) is responsible for green color. Jasper frequently show a well-developed banding. The bands may range from about one tenth of an inch to one inch in thickness. They are straight and parallel rather than concentric (opposite to banded agates).

Agate itself is a type of chalcedony quartz known for its banded patterns and wide range of colors.</p><p>In the case of evil eye agate beads, these beads are often crafted from agate and decorated or carved with the symbol of an eye. This eye symbol is meant to ward off negative energies, curses, or ill wishes that might be directed toward the wearer. The belief is that the eye amulet, by its presence or symbolism, can deflect the negative effects of the evil eye.</p><p>These beads can be used in jewelry-making, such as bracelets, necklaces, or pendants, as protective talismans or charms. The combination of the protective properties attributed to agate and the symbolism of the eye creates an amulet believed to offer protection and bring good luck.</p>","price":703518,"imageUrls":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190213/8e34d59d-a8c8-48e9-b148-00a74cc90427.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190213/a72596b0-dcbf-4086-a89c-af7f4ebc7458.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190213/5170e6d1-5294-4545-ae8e-44e200ac632d.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190213/d933c119-85e6-4438-bb94-d64acecab7f3.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2024-05-24T19:27:02.696Z","updateDate":"2024-05-24T19:27:02.696Z"},{"consignmentId":798,"id":1572,"__name":"40.6ct wood Prayer Beads with round and hulu bead For meditation & praying","status":"IN_FINAL_EVALUATION","description":"<p>40/6ct wood Prayer Beads with round and hulu bead For meditation &amp; praying</p>","price":698042,"imageUrls":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190123/9ee3bd17-b46e-4499-b620-4d0c856b0696.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190123/e16523af-595e-4158-885b-3bddad8a8165.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190123/54babc95-91fb-4989-a664-5e8e742b58b0.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190123/884301db-e7e5-41d8-a45d-b9f92805b94a.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2022-09-14T16:10:42.714Z","updateDate":"2022-09-14T16:10:42.714Z"},{"consignmentId":798,"id":1573,"__name":"37.5ct Blessed Buddah wood Prayer Beads For Meditation","status":"FINISHED","description":"<p>37.5ct Blessed Buddah Prayer Beads For Meditation </p>","price":93079,"imageUrls":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190122/ca3366b6-0736-4fc0-90b6-1abc993625bd.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190122/e3c8e07f-c347-4a4e-bc62-a58b4bfa2948.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190122/813b8798-7957-41ab-9bec-3b14b553c567.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190122/723e275c-3a99-43fb-a42c-e884a825d848.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2022-09-14T16:10:42.714Z","updateDate":"2022-09-14T16:10:42.714Z"},{"consignmentId":799,"id":1574,"__name":"106ct Jade Gemstone Natural Untreated Crystal Beads on Bracelet PrayerBeads","status":"FINISHED","description":"<p>106ct Jade Gemstone Natural Untreated Crystal Beads on Bracelet PrayerBeads</p><p></p><p>Natural untreated Jade appraised By Jade Master Appraiser </p>","price":14417,"imageUrls":["https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190120/038086c3-b9d6-4dfa-b9cd-e25ea421533f.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190120/0095918d-9c1b-45b7-acf7-8373741be772.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190120/30d039c4-e7ab-4aed-98ad-cf65e7198728.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium","https://liveplatforms-production.b-cdn.net/tenants/ja/uploads/images/190000-194999/190120/ee964354-0f3e-4525-8eac-257c0dfe41ca.jpg?width=480&aspect_ratio=1001%3A1000&auto_optimize=medium"],"createDate":"2023-11-04T18:06:10.695Z","updateDate":"2023-11-04T18:06:10.695Z"},{"consignmentId":800,"id":1575,"__name":"80.45ct antique oxhorn gemstone bracelet from canada","status":"FINISHED","description":"<p>80.45ct antique oxhorn gemstone bracelet from canada </p><p></p><p></p><p>An ox horn bracelet is a type of bracelet made from or inspired by the shape and appearance of an ox's horn.

The favorite of Cleopatra, Spanish Conquistadors and today’s Red Carpet, wars have waged over this treasured stone. In the 1st century AD, Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote that “nothing greens greener” than emeralda sentiment that continues today, as it remains one of the most sought-after gems on the market.

Turquoise is a copper ore found in arid or semiarid regions. The earliest turquoise mines were in the Sinai. In the el-Qaa region archeologists have found turquoise in tombs that are believed to date to 5000 B.C.. Turquoise jewelry and objects for ornamentation have been found in Egyptian, Persian, Chinese and Aztec historic sites.
